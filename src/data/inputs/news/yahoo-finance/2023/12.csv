SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet on Wednesday introduced its most advanced artificial intelligence model, a technology capable of crunching different forms of information such as video, audio and text.
Called Gemini, the Google owner's highly anticipated AI model is capable of more sophisticated reasoning and understanding information with a greater degree of nuance than Google's prior technology, the company said.
""This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post.
Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT roughly a year ago, Google has been racing to produce AI software that rivals what the Microsoft-backed company has introduced.
Google added a portion of the new Gemini model technology to its AI assistant Bard on Wednesday, and said it planned to release its most advanced version of Gemini through Bard early next year.
Alphabet said it is making three versions of Gemini, each of which is designed to use a different amount of processing power. The most powerful version is designed to run in data centers, and the smallest will run efficiently on mobile devices, the company said.
Gemini is the largest AI model that the company's Google DeepMind AI unit has helped make, but it is ""significantly"" cheaper to serve to users than the company's prior, larger models, DeepMind Vice President, Product Eli Collins told reporters.
""So it's not just more capable, it's also far more efficient,"" Collins said. The latest model still requires a substantial amount of computing power to train, but Google is improving on its process, he added.
Alphabet also announced a new generation of its custom-built AI chips, or tensor processing units (TPUs). The Cloud TPU v5p is designed to train large AI models, and is stitched together in pods of 8,960 chips.
The new version of its customer processors can train large language models nearly three times as fast as prior generations. The new chips are available for developers in ""preview"" as of Wednesday, the company said.

The company is working with advisers to explore a leveraged buyout, but the talks are in early stages, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. DocuSign’s market value was $12.8 billion as of Friday.
“As a matter of policy, DocuSign does not comment on market rumors or speculation,” a company spokesperson said.
A “pandemic darling,” DocuSign saw its sales and share price shoot up in 2020 as companies needed to handle more documents digitally with employees working remotely. Lately, revenue growth has slowed into single digits and “economic growth in 2024 could delay any significant improvement,” Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said earlier this month.
DocuSign, which went public in 2018, has been hurt by increasing competition from Adobe Inc.’s document business, and its valuation suffered as investors lost their taste for unprofitable software stocks. In 2022, the company named Allan Thygesen, a former Google executive, as chief executive officer, to “lead DocuSign’s next growth chapter.” The company has also undergone at least two rounds of job cuts this year, the Wall Street Journal reported in June.
While the market for document services is large, DocuSign’s prospects may remain difficult in the near term as the company “struggles to find a sustainable growth trajectory in a post-pandemic era, coupled with navigating key leadership changes and a restructuring of its sales organization,” Mark R Murphy, an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote earlier this month.
On the news of a potential sale, shares jumped as much as 15% to $64.76, the biggest intraday increase since December 2022. The San Francisco-based company’s stock was virtually unchanged this year through Thursday’s close.
A private equity purchaser is most likely, said Rana, of Bloomberg Intelligence. Large software companies such as Salesforce Inc. or Microsoft Corp. which could be logical acquirers, are likely too tied up with other issues to consider the deal, he added.

Broadly speaking, the federal EV tax credit is meant to make sure US automakers are sourcing battery components and materials from companies located in US or in US free-trade countries. In order to achieve these goals, DOE proposed new rules on December 1 that said EVs with battery components coming from a company or group designated a foreign entity of concern (FEOC) would be ineligible for the full tax credit. A company that had at least 25% ownership by a partner “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government” such as China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran is considered an FEOC.
The DOE’s proposed rules are set to apply to battery components on January 1st next year, then will expand to include suppliers of battery materials in 2025. The DOE is accepting comments on its interpretation of the rules through January 3rd.
The rules are already being felt weeks before the new year. Tesla (TSLA) noted on its website that its cheapest Model 3 sedans won’t be eligible for the full $7,500. “All new Model 3 vehicles currently qualify for a federal tax credit for eligible buyers. $7,500 tax credit will reduce to $3,750 for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on Jan 1, 2024,” Tesla said on the Model 3 order page.
“Currently, some of Tesla's vehicles use batteries from China, despite all their efforts to make batteries here in the US,” Canaccord Genuity Analyst George Gianarikas said to Yahoo Finance. “They still use batteries we think [from] CATL in China.”
Ford’s (F) Mustang Mach-E may also be affected, as it will likely lose its credit of $3,500 next year. “Beginning Jan 1, 2024, the Mustang Mach-E may not be eligible for the current $3,750 federal tax credit. If you take delivery of a Mustang Mach-E by December 31, remaining 2023 models are still eligible for the federal tax incentive!” Ford said on the Mach-E order page. The Ford F-150 Lightning EV will still retain its full EV tax credit of $7,500, according the Ford's website.
A check by Yahoo Finance finds that order pages for EVs like the Nissan Leaf EV and Volkswagen ID.4 are also stating buyers must “take delivery by December 31, 2023” to qualify for the Federal EV tax credit. Other EVs offered by GM and Rivian do not mention the loss of tax credits or having to take delivery by the end of the year. Currently only 20 EVs currently on sale from Tesla, Ford, Nissan, GM, and Rivian qualify for federal EV tax credits, per the fueleconomy.gov website.
Despite the loss of tax credits in some instances, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a trade group representing many of the automakers, welcomed DOE’s guidance.
“When it comes to China and the auto industry… it’s complicated, but this is important clarity,” AAI president John Bozzella said. “It’s important (for economic and national security) that the US controls its own destiny with supply chains and raw materials sourced domestically or from allies. That will happen. In fact, it’s already happening all over the Midwest and Southeast.”
As for Tesla, the loss of half the credit for the Model 3 RWD and all-wheel drive may impact sales in the near term, but shouldn’t be a huge concern for investors — it’s the bigger picture that matters.
“The lack of an incentive is potentially creating an ‘air pocket’ in the first quarter,” Canaccord's Gianarikas said, with the “air pocket” being a drop in sales for the Model 3.
“Maybe it means the fourth quarter estimates or actual volumes are really good because people rush to the store or rush online to buy their Tesla, leaving a little bit of an air pocket [in Q1]. We'll see how this all shakes out, but at the end of the day what really matters globally, is can Tesla sell 2.3 million plus or minus vehicles next year? We think the answer is 'yes.'”

The rollout will unfold in phases, with less sophisticated versions of Gemini called “Nano” and “Pro” being immediately incorporated into Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard and its Pixel 8 Pro smartphone.
With Gemini providing a helping hand, Google promises Bard will become more intuitive and better at tasks that involve planning. On the Pixel 8 Pro, Gemini will be able to quickly summarize recordings made on the device and provide automatic replies on messaging services, starting with WhatsApp, according to Google.
Gemini's biggest advances won't come until early next year when its Ultra model will be used to launch “Bard Advanced,"" a juiced-up version of the chatbot that initially will only be offered to a test audience.
The AI, at first, will only work in English throughout the world, although Google executives assured reporters during a briefing that the technology will have no problem eventually diversifying into other languages.
Based on a demonstration of Gemini for a group of reporters, Google's “Bard Advanced” might be capable of unprecedented AI multitasking by simultaneously recognizing and understanding presentations involving text, photos and video.
Gemini will also eventually be infused into Google's dominant search engine, although the timing of that transition hasn't been spelled out yet.
“This is a significant milestone in the development of AI, and the start of a new era for us at Google,” declared Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, the AI division behind Gemini. Google prevailed over other bidders, including Facebook parent Meta, to acquire London-based DeepMind nearly a decade ago, and since melded it with its “Brain” division to focus on Gemini's development.
The technology’s problem-solving skills are being touted by Google as being especially adept in math and physics, fueling hopes among AI optimists that it may lead to scientific breakthroughs that improve life for humans.
But an opposing side of the AI debate worries about the technology eventually eclipsing human intelligence, resulting in the loss of millions of jobs and perhaps even more destructive behavior, such as amplifying misinformation or triggering the deployment of nuclear weapons.
“We’re approaching this work boldly and responsibly,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. “That means being ambitious in our research and pursuing the capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building in safeguards and working collaboratively with governments and experts to address risks as AI becomes more capable.”
Gemini's arrival is likely to up the ante in an AI competition that has been escalating for the past year, with San Francisco startup OpenAI and long-time industry rival Microsoft.
Backed by Microsoft's financial muscle and computing power, OpenAI was already deep into developing its most advanced AI model, GPT-4, when it released the free ChatGPT tool late last year. That AI-fueled chatbot rocketed to global fame, bringing buzz to the commercial promise of generative AI and pressuring Google to push out Bard in response.
Just as Bard was arriving on the scene, OpenAI released GPT-4 in March and has since been building in new capabilities aimed at consumers and business customers, including a feature unveiled in November that enables the chatbot to analyze images. It’s been competing for business against other rival AI startups such as Anthropic and even its partner, Microsoft, which has exclusive rights to OpenAI’s technology in exchange for the billions of dollars that it has poured into the startup.
The alliance so far has been a boon for Microsoft, which has seen its market value climb by more than 50% so far this year, primarily because of investors' belief that AI will turn into a gold mine for the tech industry. Google's corporate parent, Alphabet, also has been riding the same wave with its market value rising more than $500 billion, or about 45%, so far this year.
Microsoft's deepening involvement in OpenAI during the past year, coupled with OpenAI's more aggressive attempts to commercialize its products, has raised concerns that the non-profit has strayed from its original mission to protect humanity as the technology progresses.
Those worries were magnified last month when OpenAI's board abruptly fired CEO Sam Altman in a dispute revolving around undisclosed issues of trust. After backlash that threatened to destroy the company and result in a mass exodus of AI engineering talent to Microsoft, OpenAI brought Altman back as CEO and reshuffled its board.
With Gemini coming out, OpenAI may find itself trying to prove its technology remains smarter than Google's.
In a virtual press conference, Google executives dodged questions about how Gemini compared to GPT-4 and declined to share specific technical details, such as its parameter count — one measure of a model’s complexity.
“I am in awe of what it's capable of,” Google DeepMind vice president of product Eli Collins said of Gemini.",finance.yahoo.com,"Google ups the stakes in AI race with Gemini, a technology trained to

Avarga Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
In fact, the recent purchase by Kooi Tong was the biggest purchase of Avarga shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of S$0.17. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Kooi Tong.
Kooi Tong bought a total of 2.88m shares over the year at an average price of S$0.17. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
Avarga is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.
Insider Ownership Of Avarga
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Avarga insiders own 56% of the company, currently worth about S$85m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.
What Might The Insider Transactions At Avarga Tell Us?
It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Avarga. Looks promising! I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.

Position-sizing means how much you allocate to each stock you own. Naturally, you'll want to invest more in your highest-confidence holdings while taking smaller positions in riskier stocks.
When investing $50,000 -- a considerable sum of money -- it makes sense to buy stocks with an excellent chance of delivering strong returns on your investment. It helps to find stocks with a track record of doing so and bright prospects. Here are two stocks that answer that call.
1. The Trade Desk: Leading the digital advertising revolution
The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP), meaning it offers a self-serve, cloud-based platform to help ad agencies and brands manage and optimize their digital ad campaigns. The Trade Desk delivered phenomenal results since its 2016 initial public offering (IPO), with the stock up more than 2,000%. The company has a long history of delivering strong growth and has maintained at least 95% customer retention every quarter for the last nine years.
But it's not just The Trade Desk's track record that's a reason to buy the stock. The company also has a bright future. It launched a new AI platform, Kokai, in June and the major innovations from the new technology are expected to become available to most of its customers next year.
The digital advertising market has been sluggish over the last two years as advertisers scaled back on spending in anticipation of a recession. Nevertheless, The Trade Desk outperformed its peers during that time, delivering revenue growth of more than 20% and continued profit growth.
The stock actually sold off recently on its fourth-quarter guidance, which was weaker than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. However, investors should take advantage of the sell-off as those headwinds will likely be temporary after the Federal Reserve said it planned to lower interest rates three times next year, which should help boost ad spending.
With its AI platform expected to accelerate growth, 2024 looks promising for The Trade Desk.
2. Old Dominion Freight Line: A longtime trucking leader
Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) may not be a household name, but experienced investors know this stock is a longtime winner for investors. Old Dominion is a leader in less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation. Unlike full truckload, LTL is complicated and allows for high margins for operators able to provide the service efficiently. Old Dominion is regarded as the best-in-class operator in LTL.
In the third quarter, Old Dominion posted an operating margin of nearly 30%, and the company reported 99% on-time service performance and a 0.1% cargo claims ratio, showing why it has a reputation for superior service. That's how the company can charge premium prices and generate wide profits.
As an industrial company, Old Dominion is subject to broader economic demand and has little control over shipping volume, which ultimately drives revenue growth. However, the prospect of lower interest rates should help support a recovery in the industrial economy and shipping volume. Like advertisers, shippers have scaled back in response to weakness in demand for consumer discretionary goods after retailers pulled back on orders to reduce inventory levels after a series of supply chain challenges.
Old Dominion shares are expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 35. However, the company has the ability to pass along price hikes, looks positioned to expand margins, and should benefit from a rebound in the economy. If you're looking for a stock poised to deliver solid returns for the foreseeable future, it's hard to beat Old Dominion Freight Line.

Cardinal Health: A Long History Of Strong Returns
Cardinal Health is the 14th highest revenue-generating company in the United States. With this success, the company has performed just as well for its investors.
Its most recent stock split occurred on April 23, 2001. Investing $1,000 in the company the next day — when it was trading at $30.32 — would have been good for 32.98 shares.
Today, with the stock trading at $106.57, your initial investment would be worth $3,514.67. That's a total return of $2,514.67 for doing nothing more than holding your investment for 22 years.
In addition to its strong growth, the company continues to pay dividends to its investors. Its dividend yield stands at 1.88%, reflecting a strong return on investment. This is complemented by an annual dividend of $2.0024, signifying a steady income stream for shareholders.
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is reported at 174.21, indicating investor confidence in the company’s earnings potential and its future growth prospects.
And finally, the company has increased its dividend for 38 consecutive years. This consistent growth in dividend distribution showcases Cardinal Health’s financial stability and solidifies its status as a Dividend Aristocrat.
Cardinal Health’s journey from 2001 to today is an example of a stellar investment opportunity. An initial $1,000 investment growing to $3,514.67 reflects the company’s strong financial performance and enduring appeal to investors.
Its consistent dividend increases and robust P/E ratio further cement its status as a sound, long-term investment choice, especially for those seeking stable returns and income through dividends.

Here's how.
Use iMessage on Android
Beeper Mini feels almost magical. It's dead-simple to set up and start using with a high level of security and privacy to get all the benefits of iMessage -- on Android.
Texting with Android has always been somewhat of a struggle. Those green bubbles are standard SMS text messages which come with many limitations.
Gifs, images, and videos are downscaled to much lower resolutions. Group messages seemingly don't work at times.
You can't use Tapback responses, thread replies, read receipts, typing indicators, or iMessage apps. Plus, they aren't encrypted at all.
Green bubbles have plenty of issues
Apple has promised to fix some of these issues with the adoption of RCS in the future, but it won't absolve green bubbles of all of their issues.
Fortunately, there is now a way around it and get those coveted blue bubbles.

How to get iMessage blue bubbles on Android
To start, you must first download Beeper Mini from the Play Store to your compatible Android device. It's free to download but carries a monthly fee after the initial trial.
When you open the app, it will ask for you to grant two permissions. It will ask for permission for your SMS history to import your existing conversation and for access to your contacts.
Then you must log in with your Google account. This is merely used to verify subscription status.
Beeper Mini getting set up
That's it. You're good to go and you now have blue bubbles and the litany of other iMessage-specific features on your Android device.
Security is tight and there is no server farm Mac running relaying messages, all your messages are end-to-end encrypted, your contact list is never shared, and an Apple ID is not required.
What iMessage features work
Almost all of the features iMessage touts are available for Android with Beeper Mini. The most basic of which is getting the blue bubbles.
Our first iMessage sent with Android
As soon as we set up the app, the very next text we went turned blue. We were able to send a blue bubble iMessage from our Nothing Phone (2) to our iPhone 15 Pro Max and the same in reverse.
After that first message delivered, we noticed that read receipts worked -- just as on iPhone natively. When we started sending a message back to the Android phone, we saw the typing indicator also appear.
Typing indicator in Beeper Mini
Threaded replies are supported, just by either holding on a message or swiping it to the side. These present the same as in the Apple Messages app.
All of these benefits apply to group messages too, which has been a longstanding issue. Plus, you can mute conversations.
After sending a message, if you long-hold on the bubble, you could undo sending it or edit it. There's even a countdown letting you know how long before a message is permanently sent.
Tapback effects work, replying with a heart, thumbs up, or other emojis to a specific message. Of course, gifs are sent in high resolution as are photos and videos.
Tapback, undo send, and editing messages is supported
Finally, if you opt to signing in with your Apple ID, messages can sync with all of your Apple devices. This login is sent directly to Apple and not visible or stored by Beeper Mini.
When you log in with your Apple ID you're able to send messages from an email address and from other Apple devices like an iPad or Mac.
Sign in with Apple ID for email and message sync
As robust as Beeper Mini is, we've found a few things that aren't working -- at least not yet. Sending your location for example isn't currently implemented.
Full screen message effects are no-go at the moment, such as filling the screen with fireworks, lasers, or balloons.
iMessage effects aren't supported
Similarly, iMessage apps won't ever be supported on Android since they are mini iOS apps. That means you won't be able to play games, answer polls, or send Apple Pay Cash.
During our testing we also noted that FaceTime isn't supported, but this isn't out of the cards. Apple does allow FaceTime calls on Android via a web interface so this could show up down the line.
Finally, when we tried to place a sticker directly on a message, we got some sort of error in Beeper Mini. Sending them just as an image or gif worked fine, but in-line placement seemed to fail.
How does Beeper Mini work
The bones behind Beeper Mini originated with a small project by a 16-year old security researcher. The app, then called PyPush, reverse engineered iMessage to allow it work on other platforms. PyPush was quickly acquired and became the groundwork for the all-new Beeper Mini.
We can't state this enough -- there is no Mac relay required or even an Apple ID and everything is done on your phone locally.
When you first use the app it generates encryption keys. The public keys are then uploaded to Apple's servers to authenticate your device and the private keys are stored locally on your Android device.
These encryption keys are used when sending messages. When you send a message, they are encrypted on-device before being sent so Beeper, Apple, nor anyone else will have access to them.
Beeper Mini back end setup
One of the difficult problems Beeper needed to solve, was notifications of new messages. On an Apple device, iMessage is built into the Apple Push Notification (APN) service which runs directly within the OS.
On Android, there is no APN within the OS so to stay connected, the app must be perpetually open. This isn't feasible.
Instead, Beeper has created a Beeper Push Notification (BPN) service that runs on its servers. This connects to Apple's servers and detects when a message has been sent to you and alerts you in the app.
This is able to maintain privacy as Apple separates the credentials for sending and actually encrypting/decrypting the messages. It will detect an encrypted message that it is unable to read before alerting you where the message is decrypted on your device.
If you're a developer and want to verify any of this for yourself, they've published an open source Python project that you can compile and run for yourself.
Apple's won't be able to kill it -- easily
One of the most oft-asked questions surrounding Beeper Mini is if Apple will simply make a back-end change to cut off its access. Technically, Apple could do this, but not easily. Because of how iMessage is built, Apple would have to rebuild its entire authentication processor for both iMessage and Apple IDs as a whole.
Blue bubbles on Android
This would be a massive undertaking and not something that would be pulled off quickly. If Apple were dead-set on killing Beeper Mini, it will be a long project that probably wouldn't debut until iOS 18 at the earliest.

The world’s biggest assembler of iPhones plans to spend that amount on top of the $1.6 billion it earlier set aside for the 300-acre site close to Bengaluru’s airport, people familiar with the matter said. The new capital will bankroll additional capacity for Apple devices, including likely the iPhone, people familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the information is private.
Including the most recently approved spending, the Taiwanese firm will have set aside roughly $2.7 billion for the site, set to become the centerpiece of the its manufacturing capabilities in India. The outlay underscores how Foxconn and its manufacturing peers are shifting capacity away from China, which is mired in an economic downturn and struggling to deal with US tensions.
Foxconn, Apple’s most important manufacturing partner, has ramped up its budget for the plant at least once this year. It started out in early 2023 with plans to invest just $700 million in the complex, located in the southern tech hub of Karnataka. Though the bulk of the new investment is for Apple, Foxconn is likely to use a portion of the money and the plant to make devices and components such as electric vehicle parts for other customers.
Karnataka’s government said Tuesday it had approved another 139.11 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) of overall Foxconn investment in the state, without specifying details. The company could also use the site to produce parts for its nascent EV business, Bloomberg News reported in March.
Foxconn and Apple representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Apple’s partners are accelerating efforts to establish a supply chain in India at a time Chinese firms are edging away from the country amid tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. India’s Tata conglomerate, another Apple partner, is seeking to build one of India’s biggest iPhone assembly plants in southern Tamil Nadu state.
India’s regulatory scrutiny of smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo has also discouraged some Chinese companies from setting up operations in the world’s second-largest smartphone market.

Digit is a humanoid bipedal robot from Agility Robotics that can work alongside employees.
Amazon says Digit is designed to ""work collaboratively"" with employees, not replace them.
Amazon recently began testing a new robot in its warehouse operations — meet Digit, a humanoid bipedal robot with a turquoise torso and smiley eyes.
Designed by Agility Robotics, which Amazon has invested in as part of its Industrial Innovation Fund, Digit is only the latest of a string of warehouse robots the company has introduced over the last several years. However, most of the other warehouse robots have been cart-shaped or robotic arms, not humanoid like Digit.
Digit costs about $10 to $12 an hour to operate right now, based on its price and lifespan, but the company predicts that cost to drop to $2 to $3 an hour plus overhead software costs as production ramps up, Agility Robotics CEO Damion Shelton told Bloomberg.
Of course, Digit's human-like appearance probably also isn't going to quell the fears of any workers worried they'll eventually be replaced, but Amazon is saying Digit is designed to ""work collaboratively"" with employees, not replace them.
Amazon has been building up its robot fleet for years. It had 45,000 robots across 20 fulfillment centers back in 2017, Insider previously reported, and now says it has ""750,000 robots working collaboratively with our employees.""
In June 2021, the company introduced a fleet of four robots named after characters from ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppets,"" — Bert, Ernie, Scooter, and Kermit. A year later, Amazon introduced Proteus, a fully autonomous warehouse robot which it said would operate alongside human employees, unlike its regular robots that only operate in a caged area away from human workers. In November 2022, Amazon introduced Sparrow, a picking robot arm with a suction cup hand that's meant for handling individual items in the warehouse inventory.
Unlike the company's other warehouse robots, Amazon says Digit is better designed to operate in spaces designed for humans.
""Digit can move, grasp, and handle items in spaces and corners of warehouses in novel ways."" Amazon said in an announcement on its website. ""Our initial use for this technology will be to help employees with tote recycling, a highly repetitive process of picking up and moving empty totes once inventory has been completely picked out of them.""
Amazon has often promoted its robots as a way to improve employee safety and experience.
""We are passionate about technology that makes the work experience of our employees safer, easier, and less repetitive,"" Amazon says on its website. ""Doing so gives our employees the time and opportunity to take a step back, look at how orders are moving though our sites, and find new ways to delight and serve our customers.""
But as the company builds out its fleet of robots, it's impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: Is the company doing so to eventually reduce its reliance on a human workforce?
Workers were already worried when the Sparrow arm robot was rolled out last year — one warehouse worker told Insider that it ""will take my job"" after reading Amazon's description of the robot. In community forums, warehouse workers discussed the possibility that Sparrow might result in empty warehouses, with only small teams of human employees to repair the robots. Amazon has pushed back on these concerns, saying that its robots will only create new categories of jobs within the company.
And it's still not clear whether robots will truly improve worker safety. One whistleblower report in 2020 from investigative journalism site Reveal included leaked internal data that showed that Amazon's robotic warehouses had higher injury rates than warehouses that don't use robots — Amazon strongly refuted the report at the time, saying that the reporter was ""misinterpreting data.""
""Company data shows that, in 2022, recordable incident rates and lost-time incident rates were 15% and 18% lower, respectively, at Amazon Robotics sites than non-robotics sites,"" Amazon says on its website.",finance.yahoo.com,Amazon's humanoid warehouse robots will eventually cost only $3 per hour to operate.

Raimondo Vows ‘Strongest Possible’ Action on Huawei’s Chip Breakthrough
Gross domestic product fell 0.3% following a gain of 0.2% in September, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The drop was the first since July and exceeded the 0.1% fall economists had forecast.
Services, industrial production and construction were all weaker than expected, with the three sectors contracting together for the first time since July.
Traders ramped up bets on BOE interest-rate cuts, pricing 95 basis points of easing next year — the most in the current cycle. The pound fell as much as 0.3% to $1.2525.
It marks a sharp reversal from slightly better than expected figures for much of this year and adds to the impression that Britain is stuck in a long-running stagnation. With the full impact of Bank of England interest-rate increases yet to be felt, the economy is forecast to eke out a small gain at best in the fourth quarter, with some even predicting the start of a shallow recession.
“2023 UK GDP figures paint a picture of sluggishness, bleakness, and lackluster economic performance,” said Douglas Grant, CEO of Manx Financial Group.
It also suggests Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s beleaguered Conservative government is facing a bleak economic backdrop for a general election expected to be held next year.
What Bloomberg Economics Says ...
“The larger-than-expected October GDP drop leaves the economy on track to contract over the current quarter, as high interest rates take a toll on activity. That should mark the start of the mild downturn we’re forecasting and give the Bank of England room to begin cutting rates a little before headline inflation hits 2%. Our base case is that the first move down in interest rates will come in the summer of 2024.”
—Ana Andrade and Dan Hanson, Bloomberg Economics. Click for the REACT.
Sunak has made growing the economy one of his five key promises, a commitment that rests on whether GDP expands in the fourth quarter. He’s already taking flack both from his own Conservative Party and the Labour opposition about Britain’s bleak prospects.
“These grim figures show the UK is dangerously close to recession,” said Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. “The red warning lights should be flashing. The UK is stuck in a rut and the Tories have no plan for getting us out of it.”
Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt suggested a sputtering economy is necessary to rein in inflation, also a key goal of the government.
“It is inevitable GDP will be subdued whilst interest rates are doing their job to bring down inflation,” Hunt said in a statement. “But the big reductions in business taxation announced in the Autumn Statement mean the economy is now well placed to start growing again.”
The ONS said the weather was a drag on construction, retail, pubs and tourism, with the Met Office recording the month as “provisionally the equal-sixth wettest October on record for the UK in a series from 1836.”
Businesses also suggested to the ONS that the school half-term holidays — part of which fell into November for some local authorities this year — may also have led to less activity in recreation.
Consumer-facing services fell by 0.1% in October, leaving output in the sector 5% below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. Other services combined were 7.2% above. The largest negative contributions came from other personal service activities, which fell by 2.3%.
The “broad based” nature of the weakness suggested it was more than just wet weather holding back the economy, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
That “indicates that the ongoing drag from higher interest rates is more than offsetting any boost from the rise in real wages,” he said. “Whether or not the economy contracts, the big picture is that it remains very subdued and that’s probably going to be the story for 2024.”
Human health grew 0.5%. There were three days of coordinated industrial action by junior and senior doctors in October, resulting in 118,026 appointments being rescheduled. This was less than the four days of strikes in September that saw 129,913 appointments moved. The number of Covid-19 vaccinations also increased during the month as the latest immunization campaign peaked.
Manufacturing fell by 1.1%, with widespread falls in 10 of the 13 subsectors.
GDP in October as a whole was just 2% higher than in February 2020, before the pandemic struck.
The BOE expects almost no growth at all next year, while the Office for Budget Responsibility is a little more optimistic with a forecast of 0.7%. Bloomberg Economics reckons the economy is already in a recession that will last through the middle of next year.
The lackluster outlook and easing inflation pressures are encouraging traders to bet the BOE will cut interest rates as early as June. The central bank is expected to hold the benchmark at a 15-year high of 5.25% on Thursday.
“The emerging picture is one of a sinking economy,” said Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. “The possibility that we will move into recession next year has increased.”
The economy avoided a contraction in the third quarter thanks only to a strong trade performance. Domestic demand shrank, and the hit from higher interest rates will only intensify next year when an estimated 1.4 million households are set to refinance their mortgages.
“Growth should pick up over the rest of the quarter as a sharp fall in inflation, strong wage growth and government transfers to low-income households all give consumer spending a boost,” said Thomas Pugh, economist at the audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK. “We expect Q4 to look more like a repeat of Q3 than the start of a recession.”
Britain saw its goods trade deficit widen to £17.3 billion ($21.7 billion) in October as imports rose faster than exports. Imports rose from both European Union and non-EU countries, driven by shipments of machinery and transport equipment.
Exports held up thanks to demand from outside the EU, with sales to the EU falling. The figures exclude non-monetary gold and other precious metals, flows of which can be volatile.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, Qualcomm and seven other tech companies on Wednesday teamed up to push for open digital ecosystems in response to new EU tech rules in a move that may also take the edge of possible future legislation.
Calling itself the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), the group said it wants to promote more open platforms and systems to boost growth and innovation in Europe.
The group said it will work with academics, policymakers and companies on digital openness and how this can be achieved in Europe ""through the implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and in future EU regulatory framework developments"".
The DMA requires gatekeepers -- tech giants that control access to their platforms -- to allow third parties to inter-operate with the gatekeeper's own services and allow their business users to promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside the gatekeeper's platform.
""We have had a number of conversations in the past few months about what 'good' looks like when it comes to digital ecosystems in Europe, what fosters innovation, and what will positively impact competitiveness. We think openness is the crucial element,"" Lynx founder Stan Larroque said in a statement.
Other members of the group are Chinese smart devices maker Honor, China's Lenovo, French augmented reality start-up Lynx, U.S. telecoms equipment maker Motorola, UK electronics maker Nothing, Norwegian tech company Opera and German messaging services provider Wire.
The Coalition said it aims to open up digital ecosystems through cross-industry collaboration and promote seamless connectivity and interoperable systems, among others.

The eight-page document — titled “community engagement plan” for 2024 — provides a rare glimpse into how one of American’s biggest companies executes on its public relations objectives and attempts to curtail reputational harm stemming from criticisms of its business. It also illustrates how Amazon aims to methodically court local politicians and community groups in order to push its interests in a region where it could be hampered by local moratoriums on warehouse development, and it is facing resistance from environmental and labor activists.
The memo was leaked to the nonprofit labor organization Warehouse Worker Resource Center and posted online this week. The Associated Press independently verified its authenticity.
When reached for comment, Amazon did not dispute the authenticity of the document. But it said in a prepared statement it was proud of its philanthropic efforts.
“Partnerships with community leaders and stakeholders help guide how Amazon gives back,” said Amazon spokesperson Jennifer Flagg. “Through employee volunteerism or our charitable donations, it is always Amazon’s intention to help support the communities where we work in a way that is most responsive to the needs of that community.”
In the memo, Amazon says its top public-policy priority in Southern California is addressing “labor agitation that uses false narratives and incorrect information to affect public opinion and impact public policy.”
Earlier this year, the Teamsters unionized an Amazon contracted delivery firm in the city of Palmdale and subsequently supported protests around company warehouses after Amazon refused to come to the bargaining table. Last year, dozens of Amazon workers at a company air hub in San Bernardino, a city about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, walked off the job to demand safety improvements and higher pay.
Those same issues were raised by workers at a company warehouse in New York City where employees voted to unionize with the Amazon Labor Union in 2022. The e-commerce giant has been challenging the union’s win for more than a year in a case that’s still being adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board.
The Amazon memo also says the Seattle-based company faces “significant reputational challenges” in Southern California, where it's “perceived to build facilities in predominantly communities of color and poverty, negatively impacting their health.”
The Inland Empire, a region in Southern California that Amazon discusses in the document, has seen a boom in warehouse development over the past few decades. But there's also been a groundswell of local opposition to new warehouses, with multiple municipalities enacting moratoriums on developments.
In January, dozens of environmental and community groups sent a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom urging him to declare a one-to-two-year moratorium on new warehouses in the area, arguing a temporary pause was necessary to address the “gaps in current legislation” that allows for pollution and congestion.
In the memo outlining Amazon’s goals for next year, the company says it plans to “earn the trust” of community groups and nonprofits, such as the San Bernardino Valley College Foundation, Children’s Fund, and Feeding America, to push back against state bills “that will continue to threaten the region’s economy, and Amazon’s interests.” The two bills cited include a state legislation that, if passed, would prohibit companies from building large warehouses within 1,000 feet (300 meters) of private homes, apartments, schools, daycares and other facilities.
The memo also says the company plans to “positively affect” legislative attempts to ban single use plastic by “showcasing Amazon as a leader in sustainability and counter the voices of environmental activists against Amazon.”
It also details local politicians Amazon is engaging and says the company has “cultivated” Michael Vargas, the mayor of the town of Perris, through pandemic-related ""donations to support the region, touring him and his team, and ongoing engagement.” Vargas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Media coverage is a top concern of Amazon's. The document previews the company’s goals to generate positive news stories for itself through charitable campaigns, including through a food drive hosted by the Los Angeles Food Bank where employees would drop off donations “in big media moments that are broadcasted/posted.” The memo suggested curating similar moments during a back-to-school donation event and a holiday toy drive, where drop offs occur and Amazon executives, as well as groups who receive grants from the company, “speak about Amazon’s impact” to the media.
The company additionally says it won’t continue to support organizations that “did not result in measurable positive impact” to its brand and reputation and will stop funding groups that are antagonistic towards its interest. It noted it will stop donating to The Cheech, an art museum in Riverside, citing an incident this year where the center exhibited a local artist who depicted an Amazon facility on fire and gave an interview “expressing hostility” towards the company, the memo said.
In a section of the document titled “Dogs Not Barking,” the memo lists the three things Amazon will watch closely in the region next year: warehouse moratoriums, labor organizing among contracted delivery drivers, and community groups that are not accepting charitable donations. It says some elected leaders have been hesitant to accept political contributions from the company.
Sheheryar Kaoosji, the executive director of Warehouse Worker Resource Center, said in a statement that the organization works directly with Amazon warehouse workers in the region who consistently talk about low pay, high injury rates and other concerns.
“These are critical issues that impact the entire Inland Empire, but specifically the 45,000 people who work for Amazon here,” Kaoosji said. But, she said, the memo details Amazon's strategy “to paper over these valid concerns with donations, media clippings and support for policy changes that either benefit Amazon or hurt their competitors.”",finance.yahoo.com,Amazon's internal plans to advance its interests in California are laid bare in leaked

The jump came after the group, which strenuously denies the allegations, raised $1.4 billion for a renewables project and published an initial blueprint for refinancing a solar-energy unit’s $750 million dollar bond that matures in September.
That was enough to also add a whopping $37.5 billion in market value to the group’s listed companies, while notes of the corporation’s electricity and power transmission businesses are now within striking distance of their price level before January’s report by Hindenburg Research.
The rebound suggests the conglomerate, once termed “deeply overleveraged” by research firm CreditSights, is finding favor with investors again. The group, whose operations range from cement to airports and coal mining, has yet to tap overseas bond markets since the January publication, which came at a time when rapidly rising US interest rates curbed offshore issuance by Asian companies.
Billionaire Adani has “clearly got some great assets and he’s clearly able to monetize those,” said Kamil Dimmich, a partner at London-based North of South Capital. “He’s certainly been helped by the underlying businesses becoming more profitable.”
The conglomerate’s units have about $7.5 billion of dollar notes outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About $1.58 billion of those notes come due next year, meaning the amount the firm has to pay for replacement debt will be closely watched. It’s already successfully refinanced $3.5 billion worth of credit for the purchase of two cement companies.
As part of the road map for the green energy firm’s bond, the firm said bankers will provide it with a $675 million funding letter in relation to the notes and it will use proceeds from equity transactions to come up with the money.
Over the “next three years Adani Group companies, particularly on infrastructure and green space, will likely outperform as those are all backed by robust assets,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at IIFL Securities.
There are still obstacles facing the company in the wake of the short seller report. India’s Supreme Court set up a six-member panel in March to probe if there was a regulatory failure, and also asked the local markets regulator to investigate any manipulation in Adani stocks. The outcome of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on the allegations of impropriety and shortfalls in corporate governance is still outstanding.
Apart from delving into the rout in Adani Group stocks following Hindenburg’s report, Sebi is investigating if there was a violation of rules concerning minimum public shareholding, related party transactions and manipulation of stock prices.
“The Adani group has demonstrated that they can access funding even as governance concern lingers, and we believe that it has levers to pull, including raising equity, to cover these maturities,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sharon Chen. “As funding access normalizes, we’re also watching the companies’ investment pace and the potential impact on leverage.”
Week in Review
In a sweeping series of actions, Moody’s this week lowered China’s sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable. The decision reflects its perceptions that financial support will be provided to financially-stressed local governments and state-owned enterprises, which the ratings company says “posing broad downside risks to China’s fiscal, economic and institutional strength.”
Moody’s also slashed its outlook on Hong Kong and Macau, citing signs of reduced autonomy of Hong Kong’s political and judiciary institutions after the implementation of a National Security Law. It also cut its outlook for some Chinese banks, insurers and local government financing vehicles.
Former cargo hauler Yellow Corp. agreed to sell its trucking terminals to more than 20 companies for $1.9 billion, a move that likely ends a long-shot effort to revive the bankrupt company.
UBS Group AG will redeem an additional tier 1 bond worth $2.5 billion at the first possible date next month, in a move aimed at reassuring investors after a turbulent year for the risky category of bank bonds.

Significant control over Koninklijke Vopak by private equity firms implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions
A total of 2 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership
Institutions own 22% of Koninklijke Vopak
If you want to know who really controls Koninklijke Vopak N.V. (AMS:VPK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private equity firms with 48% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
And individual investors on the other hand have a 27% ownership in the company.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Koninklijke Vopak, beginning with the chart below.
See our latest analysis for Koninklijke Vopak
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Koninklijke Vopak?
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Koninklijke Vopak does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Koninklijke Vopak, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Koninklijke Vopak. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is HAL Investments B.V. with 48% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Sprucegrove Investment Management Ltd and Maple-Brown Abbott, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 3.0%.
A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 51% stake.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.
Insider Ownership Of Koninklijke Vopak
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Koninklijke Vopak N.V.. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around €121m worth of shares (at current prices).

General Public Ownership

Private Equity Ownership
With an ownership of 48%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.

The Future of Multinational Companies
According to a report by Deloitte, a sweeping international tax policy is set to be enforced in 2024. The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.
Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

While Gates is best known as the mastermind behind Microsoft, he has amassed a fortune beyond what his Microsoft shares are worth. Despite only a fraction of his wealth coming from Microsoft, the company remains a pivotal part of his financial journey. Since Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975, the company has dominated various tech markets, achieving a market cap of over $1 trillion by 2019. Sources state only about 12.5% of Gates's net worth comes from Microsoft.
His wealth also flows from real estate investments, including the $127 million Xanadu 2.0 in Washington and the $18 million Rancho Paseana in California. Gates’s investment savvy extends through his firm Cascade, which holds stakes in luxury hotels and other ventures.
Gates’s collection of luxury vehicles, private jets and art reflects his eclectic interests, while his philanthropic efforts underscore his commitment to global causes that support initiatives in health, renewable energy and more.
As a notorious philanthropist, much of Gates's earnings go toward charitable efforts, mainly through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2023, the foundation committed $8.3 billion to fight poverty, disease and inequality, marking a 15% increase from the previous year. The foundation aims to increase its payout to $9 billion by 2026.
In 2023, Gates expanded his investment portfolio, indicating a strategic approach to wealth management. He acquired a 3.76% stake in Heineken Holding NV, valued at approximately $939.87 million. This investment signifies a diversification of his interests beyond the tech sector.
Gates has also invested in farmland, owning about 242,000 acres or roughly 0.03% of all U.S. farmland. During a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, he said that he aims to enhance productivity and job creation through these investments, with decisions made by a professional investment team.

He is the former CEO of Microsoft and is the largest individual shareholder of the software giant.
Ballmer's Microsoft stake has surged to a value of $128 billion this year following Microsoft's 55% stock rally.
Microsoft is on track to pay former CEO Steve Ballmer about $1 billion in annual dividend payments.
Ballmer, who is currently the sixth richest person in the world, is the largest individual shareholder in Microsoft. As of his last ownership disclosure in 2014, Ballmer owned 333.2 million shares of Microsoft, representing about 4% of the company.
Today, his stake is worth $128 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, after gaining $42 billion in wealth this year thanks to a 55% rally in Microsoft's stock price.
Ballmer amassed his stake over the course of his 34-year career at Microsoft, having joined the company in 1980 as employee number 30. He went on to become CEO of Microsoft in 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, and stepped down in 2014 when current CEO Satya Nadella took over the top role.
Microsoft paid $2.79 in dividends per share in 2023, which equates to an annual dividend payment of about $930 million to Ballmer based on his stake in the company.
That payout is set to increase in 2024, as Microsoft lifted its dividend 10% recently to pay $3 per share a year. That would equate to an annual dividend payment of $999.6 million to Ballmer in 2024, and it could be even higher assuming Microsoft continues its trend of hiking its dividend payment every year.
Microsoft has increased its dividend payment for 18 consecutive years, so its likely that Ballmer's annual dividend payout will top $1 billion in 2024 and continue to grow in the coming years.
Ballmer's massive stake in Microsoft has put him within spitting distance of becoming the fourth richest person in the world, as he's just a few billion dollars behind Larry Ellison and his former boss, Bill Gates.
Gates has significantly diversified his wealth away from Microsoft and towards cash and other public equities since he stepped down from the company. In fact, in 2014, Gates also owned about 4% of Microsoft, having a 330 million share stake in the company. But multiple divestitures over the years has led Gates to owning just over 1% of the software giant.",finance.yahoo.com,Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is on pace to earn $1 billion in dividends

He used his knowledge of the game to win funding from Peter Thiel, The Times reported.
The investment was one of the first Thiel made outside Silicon Valley.
Before DeepMind's Demis Hassabis became a leading figure in AI, he was a chess master who had won multiple world championships.
So Hassabis arrived for a party at the home of veteran Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel with an idea: He would use his knowledge of the game to impress the investor and win funding for DeepMind, the AI company he cofounded in 2010, The New York Times reported.
Hassabis told Thiel that the best chess players understood the unique strengths of the bishop and the knight, even though both pieces hold the same value.
""I was preparing for that meeting for a year,"" Hassabis said, according to the Times. ""I thought that would be my unique hook in: I knew that he loved chess.""
That was enough to impress Thiel. So the investor agreed to meet with Hassabis and his cofounders, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, the following day. Thiel would go on to invest about $2.25 million into their endeavor, the Times reported.
It was not only DeepMind's first significant investment but also one of Thiel's first investments outside the Silicon Valley orbit.
""I remember the first time I pitched to him, he decided to invest within the first meeting,"" Hassabis said about the encounter during a talk in 2017. ""At that time he'd never invested outside of the US, maybe not even outside of the West Coast. He felt the power of Silicon Valley was sort of mythical, that you couldn't create a successful big technology company anywhere else. Eventually we convinced him that there were good reasons to be in London.""
DeepMind, which was eventually acquired by Google in 2014 for more than $500 million, has seen several breakthroughs over the past few years. In 2016, one of its machines beat one of the world's best players at the ancient game of Go — a feat that many researchers didn't expect to see for another decade, according to the Times.
More recently, it has made an AI breakthrough that has catalyzed the hunt for new drugs and made new medical cures more possible. It's also at the forefront of developing AGI, a so far hypothetical form of AI that could perform any intellectual task a human can. Hassabis believes that an AI as intelligent as the human brain isn't far off.

Oracle's Larry Ellison said Elon Musk's xAI wanted more Nvidia chips than it could offer last quarter.
Oracle is spending heavily on scaling up to meet intense demand from clients like Musk.
Nvidia stock has more than tripled this year as investors bet the graphics-chip specialist will power the artificial-intelligence revolution. Elon Musk is among those who can't get enough of its semiconductors, Oracle's Larry Ellison said on Monday.
Musk has opted to use Oracle's servers to run his xAI company's recently launched chatbot, Grok. The cloud-infrastructure giant managed to provide enough Nvidia chips to power the first version of Grok, but fell short of Musk's demands, Ellison said during Oracle's latest earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense/Sentieo.
""Boy, did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them,"" Oracle's billionaire cofounder and tech chief said. ""We gave them quite a few but they wanted more, and we are in the process of getting them more.""
""They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more as there's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model,"" Ellison, one of Tesla's biggest shareholders, continued. ""And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter, and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter.""
Ellison gave the example of xAI after a Wall Street analyst questioned Oracle's plans to build 100 new cloud data centers, up from around 66 today. Ellison noted that Microsoft alone has ordered 20 data centers to support its Azure cloud-computing platform, and Oracle wants to build many others to meet demand from its direct customers.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz struck a similar tone, saying that the company held back last quarter to make sure it could provide larger-scale services going forward. There was ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" waiting to be scooped up, she said, but Oracle left it on the table so it could focus on building capacity ""because we need more and we need it bigger.""
Musk has been loading up on Nvidia chips for his companies for a while now. Business Insider's Kali Hays reported in April that he had purchased 10,000 graphics processors for xAI. The Tesla CEO also said on an earnings call in July that the EV maker was buying as many as it could.
""We're using a lot of Nvidia hardware,"" he said. ""We'll actually take it as fast as they'll deliver it to us. Frankly, if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so many customers.""
Ellison's latest comment about Musk and xAI suggests demand for graphics chips remains intense, which is welcome news for Nvidia investors.",finance.yahoo.com,"Elon Musk wanted way more Nvidia chips

['Daniel Howley'],2023-12-06 16:50:16+00:00,,2023-12-06 16:39:33,The coming year is expected to include an explosion in new AI technologies.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fai-whats-next-in-2024-163913202.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zpQR3jWk6m4LeozsiNsZKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-11/143ff040-9352-11ee-bfba-ed00873acb11,en,,"It’s been a little more than a year since OpenAI’s ChatGPT hit the web, setting off an explosion in interest in generative AI. In the months since, tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others have debuted or announced they’re working on their own generative AI chatbots and products.
But that’s so 2023.
We’re interested in what we can expect from generative AI in the year ahead. What kind of surprises does 2024 have in store for the tech industry—and how will generative AI influence them?
“2024 is going to be the year when it really explodes, because every day people are going to use [AI],” TECHnalysis president Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.
Think PCs and smartphones running generative AI programs, and generative AI-powered video and audio platforms.
That’s not all, though. According to experts, generative AI will become more targeted. Systems like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Microsoft’s Copilot—previously called Bing Chat—are general purpose platforms. They’re basically designed to answer everyone’s questions. But they’re not experts in individual fields.
In the coming year, companies will begin releasing models that are tailored to specific tasks, rather than those meant for broad uses.
The idea is to make generative AI less of a jack of all trades and more a master of one. Add to that the continued proliferation of more generalized AI models, and 2024 is shaping up to be another year dominated by AI.
Generative AI for consumers
While generative AI was the talk of 2023, there are still huge swaths of the world who haven’t used the technology. But as generative AI continues to permeate more of the services and products we use, you can expect more people to gain access to those platforms, said Daniela Rus, director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
“With the major foundational models that are working increasingly better, we really do see a democratization of AI and machine learning,” Rus told Yahoo Finance.
“We really see that a lot of people with access to a phone or a computer are now able to take advantage of what the technologies can do for them. And so, I see increasingly more people using the tools for their own personal purposes,” she added.
One way in which people will gain access to generative AI capabilities will be through new consumer hardware outfitted with AI chips.
“2024 is going to see the launch of AI-equipped PCs; PCs that actually can do some of the work that we’ve traditionally had to do in the cloud, on device, and that’s going to make things very interesting,” O’Donnell explained.
Google is already making such moves. In October, the company launched its Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones. The devices, which run on Google’s custom Tensor G3 chip, feature powerful AI capabilities including the ability to alter photos, remove background audio from videos, and generate wallpapers.
In the year ahead, companies ranging from HP and Dell to Lenovo and perhaps even Apple should begin integrating new AI functionalities into their devices.
AI gets more specialized
AI platforms like ChatGPT are designed to be general purpose systems. Throw a question at it about the 1997 New York Jets, and it’ll spit out an answer. Want to write a poem about leftover lasagna? It’ll do that too.
But 2024 will bring more specialized generative AI platforms aimed at specific topics and projects.
“I actually think we'll see…less general-purpose stuff,” explained University of Maryland computer science professor Hal Daumé III.
“My nose would say go where the data is, because these models are all super data hungry. So…if I had to make predictions, I would start thinking about what are the other places where we have huge amounts of data,” Daumé added.
Types of specialized generative AI applications could include platforms designed to help improve weather predictions, cybersecurity services, and medical research.
Meanwhile, chip competition heats up
Nvidia (NVDA) is the most important chip company in the world right now. It not only develops the AI accelerators that power some of the biggest AI systems in the world, the firm also offers the software needed to develop them.
But Nvidia doesn’t have enough chips to go around, so tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others are developing and using their own custom AI chips. And while that might not eat into Nvidia’s bottom line, increased competition from rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) could.
“We’re going to see a ton of other semiconductor companies…going after Nvidia,” said O’Donnell. “And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition. It always does, right?”
AMD and Intel aren’t the only ones setting their sights on Nvidia, though. Qualcomm (QCOM), which is known for its mobile chips, is also angling to become a larger presence in the AI space.
Simply put: if you thought generative AI was huge in 2023, generative AI in 2024 just might blow you away.

You can skip ahead and follow this link to read about Warren Buffett's 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.
Warren Buffett is one of the most famous and well-followed investors on the Street due to his acumen and ability to pick companies that generate solid long-term returns. Spending his entire career in investing, most of which as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.B), Buffett is estimated to have generated returns of over 20% per year on average, beating the S&P 500, which averaged around half of these figures.
Given Buffett's fame, Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13F filings are analyzed carefully in order to identify companies that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" can be followed into. Berkshire Hathaway usually keeps a concentrated portfolio with top five largest holding accounting for 73% of the total portfolio value. Berkshire's largest investment is represented by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in which Berkshire owns 915.56 million shares worth $156.75 billion, which was equal to around 50% of the total equity portfolio value at the end of September.
In order to identify Warren Buffett's 10 stock picks with huge upside potential, we assessed the consensus target price for all 45 of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.B)'s holdings and then compared it with the current stock price to assess the upside potential. Looking at the consensus price target set by analysts can be a useful metric to assess a stock's potential, even though in the past Warren Buffett himself admitted that he didn't look at analyst reports. During the 2003 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Buffett said:
Buffett's partner, late Charlie Munger, who has passed away recently, added later in the conversation:
Nevertheless, coincidentally or not, most of stocks in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.B)'s equity portfolio have a positive upside potential when compared to the consensus price target set by analysts.
Our Methodology
Once we identified the upside or downside potential of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings, we sorted them based on the percentage upside to find the stock picks with huge upside potential. The companies were sorted based on the size of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.B)'s position in them.
Without any further ado, let's jump into Warren Buffett's 10 stock picks with huge upside potential.
10. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)
Berkshire Hathaway Holding: $33.98 million
Upside Potential: 16%
In Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Berkshire Hathaway owns 227,750 shares. The UK-headquartered multinational alcoholic beverage company has been in Warren Buffett's equity portfolio since the first quarter of 2023. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)'s shares have a consensus price target of $166.37. In a recent update, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) said that it expects slower growth due to a weaker outlook in Latin America and Caribbean segment, which accounts for 11% of Diageo's sales. The sales for the LAC segment are expected to grow by more than 20% on the year in the first half of 2024.
At the end of September, there were 30 funds in our database bullish on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), up by five on the quarter.
9. Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX)
Berkshire Hathaway Holding: $389.37 million
Upside Potential: 14.10%
In its latest 13F filing, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed ownership if 7.04 million shares of Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX). Overall, there were 38 funds holding $847.91 million worth of Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX) at the end of the third quarter. Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX) is a manufacturer of building materials, which is one of the largest producers of Oriented Strand Board (OSB) panels. In its latest quarterly report, the company posted EPS of $1.62 and revenue of $728 million, beating the consensus estimates by $0.09 and $3.59 million, respectively. Analysts currently have a consensus price target of $72 on Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX) stock, which represents a consensus of 14.10%.
8. T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS)
Berkshire Hathaway Holding: $734.14 million
Upside Potential: 19%
Next on our list of Warren Buffett's 10 stock picks with high upside potential is T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS). Berkshire Hathaway has been holding shares of the telecom company since the third quarter of 2020, during which the stock has appreciated by more than 85%. At the end of September, Berkshire held 5.24 million shares of the company. However, T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) might have more room to run, as analysts predict a price target of $181. T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) also pays a dividend to its shareholders, with latest payout amounting to $0.65 per share payable on December 15.

The U.S. Treasury issued guidelines earlier this month detailing new battery sourcing restrictions that take effect Jan. 1 aimed at weaning the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain away from China.
""Tax credit will end for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on Dec. 31, 2023 based on current view of new IRA guidance. Take delivery by Dec. 31 for full tax credit,"" the company said in a notice on its website.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
In April, the Treasury said new guidelines will slash the credits for the EV maker's Model 3 RWD by half to $3,750 but that other Tesla models will retain the entire benefit.
In July, Tesla said the $7,500 federal tax credits for its Model 3 electric vehicles are likely to be reduced after Dec. 31, without elaborating on the reason.
The U.S. EV credit currently requires 50% of the value of battery components to be produced or assembled in North America to qualify for $3,750 of the credit and 40% of the value of critical minerals sourced from the United States or a country with which it has a free trade agreement.
Other carmakers such as Ford and GM expect to qualify for the entire tax credits for many of their EVs from next year, while Volkswagen remains 'cautiously optimistic'.

['Daniel Howley'],2023-12-06 15:41:39+00:00,,2023-12-06 15:00:25,"Google, on Wednesday, debuted a new AI model called Gemini. It's designed to go up against OpenAI's GPT-4.",https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fgoogle-debuts-powerful-gemini-generative-ai-model-in-strike-at-openai-microsoft-150025435.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JR6h_KQoA0Ru.UaDs9em_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/e6e0d820-7507-11ee-9f33-d13e7e5f485c,en,,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Wednesday debuted its new Gemini generative AI model. The platform serves as Google’s answer to Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI’s GPT-4, and according to DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis it's the company’s “most capable and general model” yet.
Gemini is what is referred to as a natively multi-modal model, meaning it can analyze text, audio, video, images, and code. While other multi-model offerings exist, Google says Gemini stands apart because the model was designed to take all of those mediums into account from the beginning.
Other platforms, the company says, train separate models to tackle things like text, video, and photos and then string them together into a single model.
This difference, according to Hassabis, means that Gemini is able to better understand multimodal data and produce better results for everything from handwritten content, images, and videos.
As part of the announcement, Google released a series of videos demonstrating Gemini’s capabilities. In one video, a presenter shows a program running Gemini with a drawing of a blue duck, as well as a rubber blue duck, both of which the AI is able to identify.
In another demonstration the presenter shows the AI a hand drawn picture of a roller coaster without a loop and another one with a loop. When the presenter asks which one is likely more fun, the AI says the one with the loop, which is the right answer unless you hate going around loops or roller coasters in general.
Another example shows how parents can use Gemini to help their children with their homework. Not only is the AI able to read a student’s written answers to math questions, it is also able to tell if they are correct or not and explain where the student went wrong and why.
On the coding front, Google says Gemini is one of the leading models for coding around, claiming that the AI can understand programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and Go.
Google is rolling out three different versions of Gemini: Gemini Ultra, Gemini Pro, and Gemini Nano. Gemini Ultra is the top-of-the-line, data center version of the AI model meant for what Google says are highly complex tasks. Gemini Pro is the mid-range version of the model, while Nano is the version designed to run on devices such as Google’s Pixel 8 Pro.
The company says the smartphone will use Gemini Nano to power Summarize in its Recorder app, which will allow it to understand content in a recording and provide a bulleted summary. The model will also power Smart Reply in Gboard starting with WhatsApp and eventually coming to other apps later next year.
Gemini Pro, meanwhile, is available as part of the English language version of Google’s Bard chatbot beginning today. The feature, Google says, will make Bard better at “understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning.”
Next year, the company says it will roll out a version of Bard powered by Gemini Ultra called Bard Advanced.
Importantly, Google says it’s already experimenting with Gemini in Search via its Search Generative Experience, a version of Google Search that adds generative AI capabilities. According to the company, Gemini has reduced latency in the English language version of the app in the U.S. by 40%.
Gemini will also be coming to Search, Chrome, Ads, and Duet AI in the months ahead.
Gemini is a massive undertaking for Google, serving as the company’s biggest shot at both OpenAI and its backer Microsoft.
Ever since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT in Nov. 2022, Google has been playing catch-up to its rivals. Microsoft has already added its GPT-powered Copilots to a number of its services, giving it an early lead in the new AI wars. But with Gemini, Google could have what it takes to make and even exceed OpenAI and Microsoft.
But what truly matters is how well the AI model integrates into Google’s products, and whether that will help drive consumers to continue to take advantage of platforms like Google Search, Google Workspaces, YouTube, and other products.
And while you might not notice the changes at first, Gemini is meant as a means of securing Google’s dominance into the future. And there’s little chance OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t already preparing their own responses to Gemini.

E3 established in 1995
The annual fair, held in Los Angeles since 1995, began a hiatus since June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting mass gatherings. The 2021 event was virtually and the last year's event was canceled altogether.
Following reports that companies like Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony would skip the event, the group has now ended the fair forever without explanation.

Yet for all the short-term market noise, existential fears surrounding the investing style are long standing and profound. Since markets soured at the start of 2022, the Russell 2000 is still down roughly 12%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have more or less recouped their losses.
Thanks to deep economic changes, smaller firms overall are less profitable, less exciting and more indebted — disadvantages they will struggle to overcome over the long run, skeptics warn. As private markets boom, the likes of Verdad Advisors see an industry increasingly starved of high-quality younger companies, while loss makers get listed and profitable darlings exit.
All that emboldened a Furey Research Partners strategist to sum up the threat to the asset class in blunt terms in a recent note: “It is time to face the facts — the “Death of Small Cap Equities” is upon us.”
“All of us here are tired of writing the essay that says ‘here’s why small-cap is going to work,’” said Jeff Burton, co-founder of small-caps specialist Furey, who says he penned the note with a whiff of melodrama in mind. “Our clients are well aware of some of the problems. They hear it from investors all the time.”
He still sees a resurgence for the cohort fueled by wide valuation discounts. Yet Burton understands the challenges that have spurred investor apathy. At the center of the concern is evidence of impaired profitability that some worry has become a permanent feature of the market landscape. According to Verdad, the median American small cap in 1995 posted gross profits of about 29% over assets. Now it’s just 14% — even excluding health care, with its share of profitless biotech and pharma stocks.
The contrast in balance sheets among big and small businesses has also become stark. Over the past two decades, the largest US companies doubled their earnings relative to interest payments, Societe Generale SA data show. That fortified them against the impact of rising interest rates. Small caps are nowhere near matching the feat.
Stranger still, this deterioration has been mostly an American phenomenon; in Japan and Europe, little has changed, according to Verdad.
“We see secular reasons why it won’t re-rate back to those high levels,” said Thushka Maharaj, a multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, referring to the long-term outlook for US small-caps. “It’s more profitable companies staying private because they have financing privately, but also large established companies growing their revenue because of this concentration in new innovative technology.”
Views like these are a warning to value hunters heartened by the recent green shoots in the Russell 2000 on signs the Fed is closer to easing monetary policy.
Problems for the investing style run beyond the near-term monetary outlook. And the theme of big-beating-little runs deep. Even among large caps, the concentration of gains in artificial-intelligence champions has meant that only about a quarter of S&P 500 members matched or exceeded the index’s 23% gain this year.
In a sign of mega-cap dominance, an equal-weighted version of the benchmark is set for its worst year versus the regular value-weighted one since 1998.
That’s giving succor to theories that American markets have been fundamentally transformed in the new age of tech and more than a decade of cheap money. Scalable software and networks are so winner-take-all that they favor the incumbent. And when that’s not the case, the new innovators are now remaining private for much longer thanks to the boom in private equity, the thinking goes.
“We’re seeing a greater increase in the number of just unprofitable companies that enter the universe” of listed small-caps, said Chris Satterthwaite, an analyst at Verdad. “There’s definitely some truth to the fact that the most interesting and exciting and perhaps coveted private companies are staying private longer.”
When JPMorgan Asset’s multi-asset team recently examined the small-cap premium — the higher returns these stocks are meant to reap commensurate with their riskier nature — they cut their forecasts to the lowest in years, citing the change in sector mix and growth in private capital. These small companies were actually beating the large in terms of sales growth during the 2000s – a reflection of their youthful potential. Yet by the past decade these levels had converged, data compiled by JPMorgan Asset show.
In Verdad’s analysis too, listed companies both big and small have become less profitable over the past two decades, but the drop has been far steeper for the latter, driven by the worsening quality of new market debuts.
Among smaller American stocks, a growing percentage has been financial or biotech stocks, neither known for their stellar profits. Meanwhile, tech — the S&P 500’s superstar sector — has been contributing a falling portion to the profits of small caps overall.
All that has, in turn, widened the difference in leverage between the big and small. While US large-caps have mostly financed themselves with bonds with long duration and fixed interest rates, smaller firms are now facing more pressure from debt coming due and rates surging, according to SocGen.
“We’ve seen the largest technology companies particularly in the United States but globally become even larger, and part of that has to do with the abundance of capital that these companies could expand,” said Kent Chan, equity investment director at Capital Group, which runs a $71 billion global small-cap fund. “If you go back to 1999 to 2000, the exact same thing happened and then the cost of capital increased and you started to see smaller companies innovate outside large companies.”
Chan, Verdad’s Satterthwaite and Furey’s Burton are all quick to note these top-down observations belie a treasure trove of profitable gems at potentially dirt-cheap prices. That’s a silver lining to money managers: Worsening trends mean there’s a greater case for stock picking, at a time when the S&P 500 is looking exceedingly hard to beat.
The S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which already strips out profitless stocks, is trading near the lowest valuations ever versus the large-cap benchmark in data going back to 2005. In that lens, morbid references are only a sign that small caps have been unfairly maligned.
“When you get nominal growth decelerating you get interest rates coming down — that should be good for small-caps,” said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger. “It kinds of depends on whether it’s a soft or hard landing and how far nominal growth decelerates, but I think the valuation discounts are unsustainable.”
Capital Group’s Chan agrees the market looks oversold, though he also adds he’s finding better bargains among small firms outside the US.
Yet the concern now: As the best startups choose to stay private for longer, small-cap investors simply have a worse slate to choose from. That reflects a long-term trend. Except for a surge in 2021, the number of public debuts has dropped since the 1990s, and companies coming to stock exchanges are now typically more mature, data compiled by University of Florida economist Jay Ritter show.
The number of stocks in the US has fallen 45% since their 1997 peak, with the small-cap count down by 60%, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices.
So, is the asset class lifeless? Not exactly, according to Burton, who says he titled his note partly on the hope of marking a bottom.
“Some of these issues that are plaguing small cap are real, but our view is they’re largely discounted now,” he said. “If we got close to taking the curse off small-caps by writing the death of small-cap equities, so much the better.”

The decision is an important marker in the global direction of travel toward a low-carbon energy system. The text also includes agreements to triple the deployment of renewable power and double the rate of efficiency gains by the end of the decade. A separate COP28 agreement, reached earlier, makes operations a hard-fought fund for addressing the losses and damages of climate change.
“An agreement is only as good as its implementation. We are what we do, not what we say,” Al Jaber said. “We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into tangible actions.”
The agreement required buy-in from Saudi Arabia and some other oil producers, which had pushed back on the idea of phasing down or phasing out fossil fuels. After some concessions, such as using the phrase “transitioning away” instead, the deal was clinched.

COP28 Has Failed to Deliver Finance for the Global South, CEEW Says (2:34 p.m.)
Among the countries that were disappointed with the outcome, many developing countries raised the issue of the lack of finance to meet the more ambitious goals set out in the COP28 deal known as the UAE Consensus. “This COP has largely disappointed on all fronts,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Specifically he called out the “failure to instate effective financial mechanisms, obliging historical emitters to contribute.”
Carbon Markets Are Still in Limbo (1:30 p.m.)
The approval of rules to kick-start a new UN-overseen carbon market was delayed on Wednesday, creating disappointment for investors who were looking for further clarity. “We missed an opportunity” to “set a high bar on environmental integrity, safeguards, and human rights,” said Andrea Bonzanni, international policy director at the International Emissions Trading Association.
This Is a Turning Point, Germany’s Morgan Says (1:15 p.m.)
Germany’s climate envoy Jennifer Morgan told Bloomberg News the COP28 agreement is “historic,” noting its inclusion of a target to triple renwable energy capacity. “Just a few years ago we couldn’t even get the word renewable in a text,” she said in an interview after leaving the summit’s plenary session.
“This COP is one of those key turning points and there haven’t been that many of those,” she said. “It provides more clear guidance on economic actors than before. We’ve gone from the very important temperature goal to a net zero goal to specific sectoral, quantitative targets in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And a clear signal of that transition away from fossil fuels, and that makes this a very special and significant COP.”
Colombia Calls for Cuts in Fossil Fuel Output (1:10 p.m.)
Colombia’s environment minister Susana Muhamad said that without sufficient economic support, countries would be likely to choose a transport system using dirtier transitional fuels, delaying the transition by 15 years. She added that fossil fuel output needs to be reduced.
“The production of fossil fuels needs to start being reduced,” she said. “We need to start reducing it in order to have a transition.”
Mixed Message About Gas, NRDC Says (12:05 p.m.)
The UAE Consensus, as it’s now called, may provide a concession to those countries that want to continue to rely on gas as a bridging fuel, even as it calls for a shift away from fossil fuels.
Paragraph 28 of the agreement “recognizes that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security.”
the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Jake Schmidt said the text sends a mixed message about the role of fossil gas, but limits its use.
“One cannot transition forever. And since it sits within the overall commitment to zero out fossil fuels by 2050 in the energy system, any expansion of fossil gas will come up against a hard reality – that its lifespan is severely limited and may become a stranded asset in a world transitioning away from fossil fuels,” he said.
COP28 Deal Sending ‘Signal’ to Boardrooms (12:00 p.m.)
The decision in Dubai is set to resonate in boardrooms across the world — potentially telegraphing the decline of fossil fuels and informing decisions executives make about investing in new coal, oil and gas projects.
The language pushing a decline in fossil fuel use will send “a signal” that “the world is now thinking about it” and change the way investors assess the risk of those ventures, said Jonathan Pershing, environment program director at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and a veteran US climate negotiator.
The text on fossil fuels goes beyond previous declarations that focused only on the use of coal.
David Waskow, director of the World Resources Institute’s climate initiative, said it makes a new path clear to the private sector. “This sends important signals to markets — to the private sector — about the direction of travel,” he said Wednesday.
An ‘Historic’ COP (11:30 a.m.)
“When the dust settles and dawn breaks, this will be seen as one of the most historic COPs,” said Avinash Persaud, special climate envoy to the prime minister of Barbados.
He said achievements at COP28 include operationalizing a loss and damage fund, recapitalizing the Green Climate Fund and orchestrating an international climate finance system that prepares for new levies alongside emboldened development banks and new private sector flows.
“Today, we have committed to triple renewable investments and have a just transition from fossil fuels,” he says.
Fossil Fuel Transition Rapidly Adopted (11.15 a.m.)
To huge rounds of applause, Al Jaber quickly gaveled through the decision on the Global Stocktake, which promises to transition away from fossil fuels.
“We should be proud of our historic achievement,” he says in a speech. “The world needed to find a new way. By following our north star, we have found that new path.”
“We have delivered a comprehensive response to the global stocktake and all other mandates, together, we have confronted the realities and sent the world in the right direction.”
Canada’s Guilbeault Says COP28 Deal Could Be ‘Historic’ (10:30 a.m.)
Canada’s climate minister Steven Guilbeault said the new text “could amount to a historic agreement” as it addresses the impacts of polluting and harmful energy sources, and shapes a path towards alternatives
“The package is not perfect, no UN text is,” he said in a statement. “But, as someone who has been in this space for more than 20 years, I see a vision we can rally around to keep 1.5C within reach and protect people and ecosystems.”
Guilbeault said the package is “a call to action” to all countries, cities, provinces, indigenous nations, businesses and citizens.
“The next two years are of highest importance to step up our efforts on climate, adaptation and nature,” he said. “Hard work remains.”
Thumbs-Up From China’s Climate Envoy (10:45 a.m)
China’s climate envoy Xie Zhenua walked in to the plenary that is about to start, beaming and with thumbs up. He told reporters he was happy about the latest text.
This could be his last COP, at least on behalf of the Beijing government. Xie, 74, has become a fixture of global climate diplomacy for more than a decade, but will retire after COP28. He may have got his wish to end on a high.
New Draft Calls for Economy-Wide Emissions Cuts (10:15 a.m.)
The proposed agreement makes clear — for the very first time — that countries’ Paris Agreement pledges should set “ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets” that cover all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories. One adviser noted that while the provision is decidedly unglamorous, it’s hugely significant for driving more aggressive action that goes far beyond the energy sector and carbon dioxide.
Countries’ formal emission-cutting pledges, known as nationally determined contributions, should be “aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5C, as informed by the latest science, in the light of different national circumstances,” under the draft agreement. Notably, the call for higher ambition is not just reserved for developed countries, but all nations, keeping in mind their varying circumstances.
The language neatly mirrors a call by the world’s top two emitters — China and the US — who united weeks before the summit in asserting that the next round of pledges, for 2035, should be economy-wide, bringing in all greenhouse gases and reflecting reductions aligned with Paris temperature goals.
Coal May Have Been Sacrificed for Fossil Fuel Win (09:40 a.m.)
The new COP28 proposal would have countries “accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power” — a shift from Monday’s version that envisioned “rapidly phasing down unabated coal and limitations on permitting new and unabated coal power generation.”
US negotiators had fought for language that singled out coal, and the earlier iteration clearly targeted the permitting of new plants using the fuel — wording that took a swipe at China, India and other countries. Dropping that permitting piece is seen as a possible sop for India that could bring it on board with broader language on fossil fuels.
Saudis Likely to Accept Fossil Fuel Transition (9:09 a.m.)
The transition away from fossil fuels is acceptable for Saudi Arabia because it allows them flexibility on the path they need to take to cut emissions, a person familiar with the kingdom’s position said. Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman was personally involved in negotiations and was seen walking into the presidency’s office late last night in Dubai’s Expo center.
Will China, India Agree to Net Zero by 2050? (8:53 a.m.)
A key paragraph in the new draft text commits countries to transitioning away from fossil fuels “so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science”.
But that will be unacceptable to many key countries, including China and India that have set net zero targets for post mid-century. China aims for it in 2060 and India in 2070. So would they agree to the wording in the new draft? That will be worth watching when countries speak at the plenary, which is scheduled for 10am.
‘Could’ No Longer in Fossil Fuel Text (8:37 a.m.)
There’s always a fight over modal verbs at COP, and this year it’s over how strongly countries should be compelled to act on fossil fuels.
An earlier version of the text, released Monday, had been panned by the US, EU, and other nations, for presenting a mere menu of options they “could” take to cut greenhouse gases.
The new proposal deletes “could” and “calls on” countries to contribute to an array of specified “global efforts,” including tripling renewable energy capacity globally, doubling the global average annual rate of efficiency improvements by 2030 and “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems.”
All Eyes on a Fight on the Plenary Floor (8.11 a.m.)
While the deal currently contains much stronger language on moving away from fossil fuels, the big fight may well lie ahead.
Any standoff will likely take place at a plenary gathering of ministers scheduled for 10 a.m. — a start time that is likely to be delayed. That’s where any opponents will make one final push to make their voices heard by demanding last-minute revisions to the text.
In Glasgow at COP26, India managed to shift language around an “unabated” coal phase out to the weaker “phase down” phrasing, in an intervention that was seen as also representing a bigger polluter, China. The question is whether Saudi Arabia or its peers will be willing to take an equally public stance as key opponents to a transition away from fossil fuels.
Methane Set to Receive Mention for First Time (8:06 a.m.)
Under the proposed text, countries would for the first time be agreeing to go beyond simply targeting CO2, broadening their work to include other greenhouse gases. The deal would call on nations to accelerate and substantially reduce those emissions globally, “including in particular methane emissions by 2030.”
That’s a recognition of the heat-trapping potential of methane, fluorinated gases and nitrous oxide — which are far more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to driving temperatures higher. It’s also a sign of how voluntary deals unveiled on the sidelines of the UN climate summits can eventually find their way into negotiated text. The methane language emerges from a voluntary global methane pledge the EU and US launched two years ago that has now enrolled more than 150 countries as members.
However, the language is softer than an earlier option considered by negotiators, which would have laid out specific emissions-cutting targets, including an at least 30% reduction in methane by the end of the decade and a 40% reduction by 2035.
NGO Reactions Filter In (7.42 a.m.)
The Natural Resources Defense Council, a climate non-profit, said the mention of fossil fuels in the latest text was much stronger than early versions, sending a signal that a century dominated by dirty energy is rapidly coming to an end.
The text points to the end goal for carbon as “zero by 2050” and demands that the world accelerates action “in this critical decade.”
NRDC said that while the wording could be still reinforced to include all fossil fuels — not just those in the energy system – the signal is clear that the end of the fossil-fuel era has come.
Developing Countries Win Concessions (7.36 a.m.)
The COP28 presidency has looked to give emerging nations a number of wins to get a final agreement over the line.
In addition to allowing for different transition pathways, the proposal emphasizes that finance and technology transfer are “critical enablers of climate action.” That yields to a push from developing economies struggling to balance the need to grow their economies with the need to slash emissions.
Wealthier nations also came in for criticism over progress thus far.
“Parties and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had earlier indicated that developed countries must reduce emissions by 25–40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020,” the text says. “Which was not achieved.”
Countries Have Different Transition Pathways in Draft Deal (7.25 a.m.)
The key change in the current draft is a shift away from “reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner” in a key section of the text.
Instead, the new document calls on countries to start “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science.”
Nations voting in favor of this version would agree that there is a “need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5C pathways.” They would be called upon to take a variety of “steps” to address them, charting their own paths “in a nationally determined manner.”
The phrasing reflects a principle that countries have common but differentiated responsibilities when it comes to addressing climate change.
New Draft Calls for Fossil Fuel Transition (7:09 a.m.)
The latest draft deal, likely the one the COP28 Presidency tries to take into the final plenary, calls for a transition away from fossil fuels to enable the world to reach net zero by 2050. It’s a stronger text than Monday’s draft but could yet face a last-minute Saudi objection.
The text also added a line saying that transitional fuels — which, for developing nations include gas — can play a role in the shift away from carbon. A line on limiting new coal-power generation was omitted, but countries are called upon to accelerate the phase-down of unabated use of the dirty fuel.
UN Carbon Market at Risk as COP28 Split on Rules (5.49 a.m.)
The fate of a United Nations-overseen emissions market that could help channel climate finance to poor countries is in doubt as nations at the COP28 conference are at odds over its rules.
The European Union and some Latin American countries rejected recommendations on the functioning of the mechanism. An attempt last night failed to secure a compromise, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A lack of endorsement of the standards proposed by the market’s supervisory body would mean a delay in making the market operational and no clarity on the next steps.
At stake is a mechanism enabled by the Paris Agreement that would allow companies compensate for some pollution at home by investing in projects in developing countries to cut emissions or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Saudi Oil Minister Arrives to Meet COP28 Officials (12:30 a.m.)
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman arrived at the presidency shortly after midnight. He walked past reporters, listening to an aide reading from a mobile phone. This is an important meeting — if Saudi Arabia agrees to something close to the proposed draft, we’re pretty close to the end.
New COP28 Draft Demands Swifter Fossil Fuel Transition (12:12 a.m.)
A copy of the compromise text under discussion was seen by Bloomberg News. It represents a more forceful assertion of the world’s commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions while steering clear of polarizing promises to “phase out” fossil fuels that had drawn fire from Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations.
India Suggests Fossil Fuel Language Needs Caveats (10:03 p.m.)
India’s chief negotiator Naresh Pal Gangwar met the COP28 presidency as part of the BASIC group, alongside China, South Africa and Brazil. On fossil fuel language, he said they suggested that the presidency must take into consideration countries’ “different circumstances” and varying stages of economic development.
COP President Meetings Will Continue Until 3 a.m. (9:38 p.m.)
“Overnight and throughout today, the COP28 president and his team have been engaging in extensive consultations with a wide representation of negotiating groups and parties,” a COP28 spokesperson said in a statement. “This is to ensure everyone is heard, and all views are considered. He is determined to deliver a version of the text that has the support of all parties. Consultations will continue until 03:00AM GST.”
Kerry Says New Deal Text Is Stronger on Fossil Fuels (9:23 p.m.)
US climate envoy John Kerry said “progress is moving in the right direction” as he emerged from a meeting with other key ministers and the UAE presidency minutes ago. The text had already been made stronger on fossil fuels, he said, and there had been “a lot of good effort” on financial commitments.
The text is “in a very different place from where we were yesterday, and it reflects
the consultative process,” Kerry told reporters. “People have listened very carefully and there’s a lot of good faith on the table right now — people trying to move to a better place.”
Kerry said the talks were setting up a potential release of the next draft “in the wee hours of the night.”
Canada Seemed Pleased by the Direction of Talks (9:06 p.m.)
Canadian climate minister Steven Guilbeault said that the 1.5C temperature target laid out by the Paris Agreement was “absolutely” still alive after he left a meeting with COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber.
“We keep 1.5C within reach,” he told reporters. “I leave the meeting encouraged. Much more than yesterday.”
Norway’s Minister Steps Out of UNFCCC Office in Upbeat Mood (8:52 p.m.)
Walking out of the UNFCCC pavilion Norway’s Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide said discussions are “positively progressive.”
Earlier this evening, the minister told Bloomberg News there are still major items to agree upon. “There is serious work going on to make a text we can commit to, with stronger language on mitigation and adaptation, but it’s not done — there will be stronger language on adaptation and mitigation, but exactly what it is we’ll have to see,” he said.
Long Night Expected at Expo City, Despite Deal Optimism (8:45 p.m.)
Even if a deal is done in the next hour or so, it doesn’t necessarily mean COP28 will be able to wrap up tonight. A new text needs to be written, approved by lawyers and translated into five languages. Then there’s a lot of bureaucracy on the plenary floor that needs to be agreed before negotiators can even start to talk about the crucial fossil fuel wording.
UK Minister’s Trip Home Hasn’t Sat Well With Tory Opponents (8:38 p.m.)
The UK government has been under criticism at home today after Graham Stuart, the minister responsible for COP, flew home. Instead, Richard Benyon a minister in both the environment department and foreign office, was present at a key huddle of ministers with Kerry as talks neared to a close.
US Climate Envoy Says He’s Working on a Stronger Deal (8:20 p.m.)
US climate envoy John Kerry struck an optimistic tone before heading into a meeting in the COP presidency office with ministers from Canada, Japan, Norway and other nations.
“We’re working very hard for that,” he said, referring to a stronger deal.
“I’m confident that we are going to see a different text,” he told Bloomberg News. “But, you know, we are working on that. I’m hopeful. I really am. Hopeful.”
Just before going into the meeting, ministers gathered for an impromptu huddle. Kerry smiled as he spoke to the assembled negotiators, at one point slapping two on the back. Music from a nearby restaurant thrummed in the background.
COP28 CEO Amin Says We’re on Cusp of a Deal (8:15 p.m.)
There’s a sudden mood of optimism around Expo City. COP28 CEO Adnan Amin, a key lieutenant of the summit’s president, Sultan Al Jaber, just told Bloomberg we’re on the cusp of a deal. Meanwhile, a big group of ministers is waiting outside the presidency office for a briefing.

Raimondo Vows ‘Strongest Possible’ Action on Huawei’s Chip Breakthrough
Three days of polling concluded around 9 p.m. local time Tuesday, with electoral authorities due to announce an initial vote tally today. The final results are scheduled for Dec. 18.
Authorities have encouraged as many as possible of Egypt’s 67 million eligible voters to take part, describing casting a ballot as a national duty. They’re keen to avoid any suggestion of apathy in a country where inflation is running at 35% and foreign investors expect another currency devaluation in the coming months.
Read More: For Some Egyptians, Their Honeymoon Starts at the Ballot Box
Turnout for the first and second days was more than 45%, the electoral commission said Monday, already higher than the vote in 2018. El-Sisi won around 97% of ballots back then and in 2014, when the former field marshal first took office.
El-Sisi once again faces little serious opposition in a bid for a new six-year term that would extend his rule until 2030. With the outcome not in doubt, authorities have instead focused on getting people to participate. At polling stations, crowds waved national flags and sang patriotic songs. Several Egyptian movie stars publicized their trips to voting stations on social media.
Now the polls have closed, many voters’ minds will return to Egypt’s soaring cost of living. Three currency devaluations since early 2022 have seen inflation jump, and many in the country of more than 105 million people are struggling to make ends meet.
Read More: Egypt Needs Cash and Gaza War Gives World New Reasons to Help
The widespread hardship could test El-Sisi. Protesters helped topple his two predecessors: long-time strongman Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring 12 years ago and Islamist Mohamed Mursi in 2013.
A further weakening of the pound, which has already lost half its value against the dollar with the devaluations, would pile more pain on consumers. Such a move, though, may be necessary to ease dire shortages of hard currency and help authorities obtain a rescue package of over $5 billion from the International Monetary Fund.

El-Sisi, a career military officer before he turned to politics, is also confronted with challenges related to the Israel-Hamas war, which has revived Egypt’s diplomatic role in the region.
Read More: Egypt Is Courted on All Sides as Pivotal to Gaza Refugees’ Fate
The nation is the only gateway for aid to reach Gaza and was a key player in hostage talks that enabled a brief truce in the two-month conflict in late November.
Many Egyptians have rallied round El-Sisi over the war, supporting his refusal to accept a mass relocation of Palestinians into Egypt lest they bring Hamas with them and aren’t allowed back to their homeland. They’ve also backed the call from him and other Arab leaders for a cease-fire as the death toll among Palestinians mounts.
Yasser Gaber, who sells ice cream from a bike cart in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, said the cost of living was “much more affordable” before El-Sisi took charge. But “safety and security is much better,” he said.
The president’s “a military guy who makes the state security his priority,” said Gaber, who has three kids and earns about 150 pounds ($4.85) per day.
Like him, many Egyptians say security is just as crucial a consideration as economic conditions.
“The most important thing is to live in safety,” Sameh Magdy, a 48-year-old engineer, said at a polling station in the Cairo neighborhood of Nasr City.

Swedish unions have taken industrial action against Tesla since October in a bid to force the car manufacturer to sign collective bargaining agreements with mechanics.
""We consider blocking transportation of Tesla cars through Norway to Sweden unless Tesla reaches an agreement with Sweden's IF Metall union,"" a spokesperson for the Norwegian union told Reuters.
On Tuesday, Denmark's 3F labour union also said it would support the Swedish mechanics by refusing to unload or transport cars made by the U.S. auto company for customers in Sweden.
The Norwegian and Danish unions said their actions would only affect cars that are meant for the Swedish market.

Shiseido’s average target price has fallen 13% over the past month, the most among Japanese companies with a market cap greater than ¥1.5 trillion ($10 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. cut its target by 34% on Monday, following downgrades from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. in November.
The stock is set for an unprecedented annual drop of 38% after the company reduced its full-year profit forecast in November on slower demand from China, following the release of treated radioactive wastewater at Fukushima in August. Pressure on earnings has been worse than expected on China’s economic slowdown, Fukushima’s water issues and prolonged travel retail inventory adjustments, SMBC Nikko analyst Shima Yamanaka wrote in a note.
Shiseido’s slump over recent months places it among the most oversold stocks in the cosmetics sector, Goldman Sachs strategists including Bruce Kirk wrote in a note. Still, conditions are sensitive to China sentiment, which could change quickly on any stimulus or policy shifts, they wrote.

While it didn't work completely alone, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry was one of the leading growth drivers in the stock market's recovery in 2023.
In 2022, macroeconomic headwinds saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33%. However, the same index has surged 42% since Jan. 1, almost wholly based on excitement over AI. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reignited interest in the technology and has seen countless tech firms pivot their businesses to the sector.
As a result, the AI market is projected to deliver a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Despite bull runs for many AI stocks this year, there are still some attractive opportunities to invest in the $137 billion industry.
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two compelling options -- both are home to some of the world's most recognizable brands and are heavily investing in the technology. So, let's examine whether Alphabet or Amazon is currently the better AI stock.
Alphabet
Alphabet is no stranger to AI, with CEO Sundar Pichai saying in a blog post earlier this year that the tech giant was seven years into its journey as ""an AI-first company."" However, like many firms, Alphabet has ramped up its expansion into the market in 2023.
The company started 2023 by unveiling Bard -- an AI chatbot designed to be an alternative to ChatGPT -- in February. The launch was a bit of a fumble, with Bard making mistakes at its debut presentation and leaving investors questioning Alphabet's prospects in AI. However, the company seemingly learned from the miss, pulling back to take the rest of the year to get its next project right.
In 2024, Alphabet will launch Gemini, a new large language model expected to be highly competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4.
Combined with potent brands such as Google, Android, and YouTube, the company has almost endless opportunities to monetize its AI technology. From the ability to offer more efficient advertising to bringing AI upgrades to Google Search and Cloud, Alphabet could play a crucial role in getting AI into the hands of billions of consumers.
Moreover, Alphabet posted more than $77 billion in free cash flow in 2023, more than Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta Platforms. The company has the funds and brand recognition to overcome potential headwinds and flourish in AI over the long term.
Amazon
Amazon has been a favorite on Wall Street in 2023, with its stock up about 80% since Jan. 1. The company has rallied investors with a return to growth in its e-commerce segments and a quickly expanding position in AI.
Businesses worldwide are increasingly seeking ways to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) are well equipped to meet rising demand and profit significantly over the long term.
AWS holds a leading 32% market share in cloud computing, ahead of Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon is using its cloud dominance to get ahead in AI, introducing a diverse range of services to AWS this year. New tools such as Bedrock, CodeWhisperer, and HealthScribe use generative technology to help businesses boost productivity and could attract new customers to AWS in the coming years.
In addition to software, AWS announced a venture into chip development in June. Market leader Nvidia has enjoyed soaring earnings in 2023 thanks to a spike in AI chip sales. Amazon plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the near future as it works to strengthen and diversify its role in the budding industry.
Is Alphabet or Amazon the better artificial intelligence (AI) stock?
Alphabet and Amazon attract millions, if not billions, of users daily, making it challenging to go a single day without using at least one of their products. Their penetration in the consumer and commercial markets has given them massive earnings potential in AI over the long term. However, just because a company dominates an industry doesn't mean its stock trades at the right price.
This chart compares these companies' price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-free cash flows, with Alphabet winning on both fronts. Alphabet's significantly lower figures suggest its stock currently offers more value and is a bargain compared to Amazon's.
Alphabet has been slightly overshadowed in AI by peers like Amazon and Microsoft in 2023. However, that has only kept its shares at an attractive price point, making it a screaming buy ahead of 2024 -- and the better AI stock.

Core price measures that exclude volatile items like food and energy are easing, along with costs of services, policymakers wrote in the minutes of their Dec. 12-13 meeting, when they lowered the Selic to 11.75% and pledged to maintain the half-point pace of easing at their next meetings.
Still, some sources of disinflation “have been exhausted,” the board wrote. Additionally, the committee said it “slightly raised” the inflationary impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon on food prices.
“There is still a long way to go to anchor expectations and bring inflation back to the target,” board members wrote in the document published on Tuesday. A “contractionary and cautious” monetary policy is still needed to reinforce the current disinflation path, they added.
Brazil policymakers led by Roberto Campos Neto are carrying out a gradual easing cycle that has already shaved two percentage points from borrowing costs since August. Headline inflation eased for the second straight month in November, and closely-watched core measures excluding volatile items like food and energy are also cooling. Central bankers see the improvements as “in line” with their estimates, reinforcing their pledges to act with caution.
The central bank delivered a a more hawkish message in light of the improvement in the global outlook, said Leonardo Costa, an economist at asset manager Asa Investments.
“They see very little to celebrate in the process of domestic disinflation,” he said. “It indicates there is no mechanical relationship between the external scenario and domestic rates.”

Brazilian central bankers have gotten help from an improving global economic environment. US Treasury yields have fallen from a peak, and last week the Federal Reserve signaled odds of its own easing cycle next year.
Several Brazil central bank board members now see better chances of the US economy avoiding a recession despite high borrowing costs.
They also highlighted an uncertain geopolitical context, and signs in advanced economies that point to hot labor markets and a tight output gap. The board will “continue to monitor” the global outlook and its impact on domestic activity, they added.
Most analysts expect annual inflation will ease to 4.49% this month, ending the year within the tolerance range for the first time since 2020. Yet, their estimates for medium-term price increases are proving sticky, with forecasts for 2025 and 2026 holding steady above the 3% target for over five months.
Brazil traders and analysts continue to bet the benchmark Selic will drop to 9.25% in 2024, with half-point reductions at least through May before central bankers slow their pace to quarter-point cuts.
Latin America’s largest economy has puzzled analysts who had expected a recession, instead posting better-than-expected growth most of this year.
Still, recent indicators suggest an economic slowdown is finally taking hold. The services sector shrank by 0.6% in October, its third straight monthly decline.

['Jaimie Ding'],2023-12-03 11:45:14+00:00,,2023-12-03 11:00:24,"Ever since TikTok launched its in-app shopping feature, creators have flooded the platform with product testimonials. Why are they so dang convincing?",https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-tiktok-dangerously-good-making-110024994.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sxClkT95pyyVrxTtynmixA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/045ca19d3208b5de4437327b410f28bf,en,,"As I was scrolling through TikTok the other day, I received a text from a friend.
“I take back everything bad I said about TikTok Shop,” she said. “I just bought a Staub Dutch oven for like $100. And it’s normally like $400.”
I had no idea what a Dutch oven is used for, but I thought I might need one too. I mean, I had to at least check — the deal was too good to be true. Thankfully, I came to my senses and did not buy one.
But I did spend almost $100 on other items from TikTok Shop that day.
Ever since TikTok officially launched its in-app shopping feature in the U.S. in September, it’s quickly turned the video-scrolling app into a budding e-commerce marketplace. The new feature sells about $7 million worth of products a day in the U.S., with a goal of reaching $10 million a day by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.

Although TikTok Shop has a ways to go before it can truly match up to the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon in terms of sheer volume, customer trust and delivery logistics, what it does have is unparalleled command over eyeballs.
TikTok has 150 million users in the U.S., 35% of whom are ages 18 to 24. Teens in particular spend an average of nearly two hours a day on the app.
And TikTok Shop is proving to be remarkably effective at turning that screen time into shopping time.
Psychological warfare
It’s impossible to spend any amount of time on TikTok these days without encountering an ad or a video that has a product linked for commission.
And not just any product. I routinely see the same slew of items — specifically targeted to blend into my feed of fashion, mental health and art content — over, and over, and over again until I could practically market them myself.
A brown faux leather shoulder bag, big enough to carry someone’s laptop, a few books, phone, wallet. The Beachwaver, a rotating curling iron that will curl your hair in minutes. A shadow work journal to help you heal your inner child. The OQQ three-piece women’s body suit that will snatch your waist, even if you just gave birth. A 100-color watercolor set that comes with 35 metallic colors and three water brush pens.
Repetition as a promotional strategy is nothing new, but on TikTok Shop it feels like a form of psychological warfare. I’m losing the battle — or at least my credit card is.
This endless onslaught of product videos is being generated by a growing number of creators who almost exclusively focus on recommendation or review videos. They talk directly into the camera while unboxing or trying out a new product. They’re chatty and affable, and they seem like regular people who are genuinely recommending something they’ve found useful or enjoyable in their everyday lives.
Read more: TikTok's addictive anti-aesthetic has already conquered culture
Now one video on its own isn’t going to persuade me to buy something, but scrolling through 10 or 20 videos featuring real-life testimonies about the same product might be enough to get me to cave.
“This is the toner that was ranked No. 1 in Korea for months and months and months and months,” a woman tells me knowingly, her hair freshly wet from the shower and two white toner pad squares on her face. “When I was in Korea I stocked up back in March.”
She held up a bottle that I had already seen recommended by two other accounts. All three women had smooth, shiny plump skin — the kind of skin that stays tantalizingly out of reach for me.
Los Angeles creator Dina Asprer said she doesn’t consider herself an “influencer” or a “TikTok person” but had always been passionate about Korean skincare, having lived in Korea for five years after college.
The 31-year-old quit her banking job during the pandemic to spend more time with her kids and only made TikToks for fun. She started putting links to products in her videos in June when the option became available to some users.
One particular item took off — a snail mucin essence from popular Korean brand COSRX. At one point, she was earning commission from selling 600 bottles a day, and now still sells around 1,000 bottles a month.

“I never considered this as a job, but I’m starting to take it more seriously,” Asprer said. She’s even attended a few workshops that TikTok offers to help creators grow, traveling to its office in Culver City.
In another video that pops up on my feed, a woman demands my attention.
“Listen to me,” Katelyn Beaupre says urgently. “If you have eczema or dry skin, I’m about to put you on.”
I don’t have either, but for some reason, this information feels important to know.
Beaupre explains that she works at a daycare and has OCD, which means her hands are extremely dry from washing them frequently. Other products made her hands greasy, but this one — which she purchased after seeing it all over TikTok — was so good she was bringing it in for her co-workers to try.
“I was a little skeptical at first because I really didn’t like the smell,” Beaupre says. “To me, it smells like oregano.”
That video, featuring a lotion by the brand the Ocean Healed My Eczema, has 3.6 million views. She posted about it a few more times. Last month, she made about $20,000 in commissions.
The 22-year-old from Massachusetts has a little more than 95,000 followers on TikTok and makes videos when she has time, outside of working at a preschool full time and going to school part time. But the commissions she’s earned in the last two months has helped her to pay off her credit card debt and student loans.
Read more: What happens to social media influencers when inflation hits?
Commissions range from 20 cents to $7 a purchase and can fluctuate if a certain product, like the rotating curling iron for example, starts trending, leading to more influencers making videos about it, Beaupre noticed.
“Sometimes I try to go for things that are a little bit higher in commission,” she said.
She also indicates in her profile that she’s a “UGC + lifestyle creator,” which means her videos are available for companies to use as user-generated content in paid TikTok ads.
The eczema lotion that Beaupre promoted first offered a $4.99 commission, or 20% of the price, before lowering it to closer to $3.
Maybe that’s why there are countless other videos of creators raving about the very same product. Yet they still feel honest. People showed before-and-after pictures of their hands, legs and elbows, some using it for eczema and dry hands and others for psoriasis.
The company has made it simple for sellers to make products eligible for commission and creators to request free products and post videos with a direct link to generate sales, streamlining a process that otherwise might have required more business-savvy from both sides. TikTok Shop has just two requirements for commission-eligible creators: you must be over 18 and have at least 5,000 followers.
Gen Z’s QVC shopping channel
Every week, Brandon Hurst sells more than 1,200 plants from his 800-square-foot apartment in Van Nuys.
He carefully packages each one — golden pothos, string of hearts, trailing hoya — with a small team of employees, slaps on a bright sticker that reads “live plants,” and ships them across the country. Then the next batch arrives at his apartment, ready to be sold.
His secret? Live selling.
Hurst makes a majority of his sales through TikTok live streams every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when he greets loyal customers, welcomes newcomers and talks about the plants available in his shop. He joined TikTok Shop in April before its formal launch, and he’s sold more than 30,000 plants since — more than the amount he sold in the three years before joining the platform.
“I try to turn it into kind of like a show, a little bit like QVC,” Hurst said of his livestreams. “Literally within the first five minutes, we already are at like 10 or 15 orders. It’s incredible.”

Although he already had viral plant videos on the app before joining TikTok Shop, it “didn’t equal sales the way that it now can, with the link right there in the video,” Hurst said.
Live selling online first emerged in China several years ago and exploded during the pandemic. Two-thirds of Chinese consumers purchased a product via livestream within the previous year, according to a 2020 survey.
In 2022, an estimated $500 billion in goods were sold via livestream in China, accounting for about 23% of all e-commerce sales in the country, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Two of China's top live-streamers were able to sell $3 billion worth of goods in one day in October 2021.
Although the phenomenon hasn’t quite reached that scale yet in the U.S., platforms like Amazon, EBay and Poshmark have all launched their own live shopping features. The U.S. live selling market was expected to reach $32 billion in sales this year.
Whenever I scroll through TikTok these days, I stumble upon at least one livestream pitching me a product I didn’t know I needed.
Lately, it’s been a fast-talking man extolling the virtues of an electric scrubber. As he demonstrated its efficacy on a shower door recently, I pondered whether I should be deep-cleaning my bathtub.
“Thank you for your new orders, thank you thank you,” he said as he aggressively rang a bell. “You are doing a fantastic job.”
Next, a woman was holding up the OQQ bodysuits that have been viral on TikTok for a while. I had been thinking about buying them for months. She wore one herself, as did another model who slipped in and out of frame.
“Go ahead and snag them while they’re hot for sure,” she said. “We are already selling out today.”
I entered my height and weight into the chat to ask what size I should purchase. I was surprised to hear her address me by name.
“Jaimie, we’re out of stock of the extra small, so I’d go with the small,” she said. With her blessing, I tapped “buy,” selected my size, and checked out with Apple Pay.
Thirty seconds later, my brain humming from the dopamine hit, I’m back to scrolling through my usual TikTok feed and looking for the video that will pique my interest next.
Pitching the pitchers
I did not make my first purchase on TikTok Shop without a fair bit of skepticism.
Were all these products low-quality, drop-shipped items from overseas? Were they cheap knockoffs from unknown Chinese companies, like many listings on Amazon?
Read more: TikTok’s new Amazon copycat is full of cheap Chinese goods
Given some of the cut-rate prices, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons to companies like Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish, where it’s often a toss-up whether the item you just ordered will be of durable quality or complete junk.
The biggest barrier to more widespread adoption of social e-commerce is consumer trust, said Laura Gurski, North America commerce lead at Accenture Song. This is especially true among older demographics who are used to buying from reliable retailers and brands.
This is why sellers earnestly pitching their own products can do to such great effect through TikTok videos. They’re in part borrowing tactics you might see on shopping channels like QVC, where trained hosts create intimacy with the viewer by gushing over products like they’re gossiping with a friend. But unlike perfectly polished QVC hosts in a studio, the TikTok entrepreneur is unfiltered and up close — sometimes even awkwardly so — right there on your phone screen.
Father-son duo Michael and Daniel Jay of San Diego started their brand Lazy Butt Club as a revamp of Michael’s old T-shirt designs from decades ago. They went from less than 100 orders a year to 3,000 in a few weeks after their first viral TikTok video in 2021.
“Ever since we switched to being more personal and showing you what we’re doing and our story, it’s been a lot easier to resonate with people,” said Daniel, who runs the TikTok account.
In one video, I watched Michael pull out one of his hand-drawn rough drafts of a T-shirt design out of a box. In another, he screen printed “Tyrannosaurus Wrecks” onto a crew neck, telling viewers that it would be the first one he’s printed in 25 years.
They joined TikTok Shop over the summer, generating a few thousand orders since then through both the platform and their website. It’s opened up new avenues of business for them.
“One of the intimidating things about trying to work with influencers is having that business side already figured out, like how to pay them,” Daniel said. “I kind of didn’t even know how to formulate a message and ask people, like how much should they get paid or whatever.”
Sellers like the Jays help TikTok establish trust, so the platform has been aggressively courting them with a variety of incentives, such as covering the cost of free shipping for some buyers and offering frequent sales and coupons.
“When we first signed up, we were like, wait — free shipping, like what do you mean free shipping? What is this sale?” Daniel said. He was amazed to learn that a customer could purchase one of their shirts for as low as $8, while his company received the full price.
With all the perks, several sellers said they don’t even list items on Amazon because they consider the process too complicated or time-consuming, and the site generates too few sales.
Chief Executive and founder Jay Nagy launched the Ocean Healed My Eczema in July directly onto TikTok shop.
In just three months, he said he’s sold more than $1 million worth of eczema cream through the platform. It went viral with the help of creators like Beaupre, and through Nagy’s videos about his own experience with eczema.
“TikTok Shop is so smart, it just puts it in front of the right people. It’s really wild,” Nagy said. “They gave me the platform to really tell my story with my struggle with eczema.”
When I first discovered Nagy’s product, it was through a series of videos from creators that appeared during my daily TikTok binge-scrolling session. I have watched enough testimonials — more than 10 — to be convinced of its effectiveness.
But I haven’t bought the cream.
After all, I don’t have eczema.
So I obviously don’t need it.

That’s where OpenAI chief scientist and cofounder Ilya Sutskever currently finds himself, and Elon Musk thinks he should jump ship for Tesla or xAI.
Last month, Sutskever joined other OpenAI board members in firing CEO Sam Altman for vague reasons, kicking off a short-lived but dramatic corporate saga. With help from Microsoft and other investors, OpenAI quickly reinstated Altman and then set about revamping its board.
Altman made a point to mention Sutskever in a statement about his return, writing: “I harbor zero ill will towards him. While Ilya will no longer serve on the board, we hope to continue our working relationship.”
But on Friday, Business Insider published a report suggesting Sutskever is in a state of limbo and has recently become “invisible” at OpenAI. When an X user shared that article in a post and wrote that Sutskever should join Tesla, Musk replied, “or xAI.”
AI recruiting battle
Musk started xAI in March and last month announced Grok, its AI chatbot competing against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But if AI history had unfolded a little differently, Musk might today be more associated with OpenAI. Musk helped start, fund, and lure key talent to OpenAI in 2015, when it launched as a nonprofit—and he persuaded Sutskever, who had been at Google, to join OpenAI.
“That was one of the toughest recruiting battles I’ve ever had,” Musk told the Lex Fridman Podcast. It was also “the key moment,” he addded, in the friendship breakup between Musk and Google cofounder Larry Page.
Musk, who had been on OpenAI’s board, left on a sour note in 2018 after a power struggle. Shortly after, OpenAI, needing capital and computing resources, switched to a capped-profit model and started accepting hefty investments from Microsoft.
That partnership, which antitrust authorities in the UK are now looking into, did not go over well with Musk, who tweeted earlier this year: “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.”
Sutskever's 'moral compass'
After the OpenAI board fired Altman last month, Musk wrote, “Given the risk and power of advanced AI, the public should be informed of why the board felt they had to take such drastic action.” Musk has long warned of the potential dangers of AI but also sees its promise.
Helen Toner, an academic who was on the OpenAI board before resigning after Altman’s return, recently told the Wall Street Journal that the CEO firing “wasn’t about AI safety, it was about a lack of trust.” And Sutskever himself backtracked after Altman returned, writing on X, “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions.”
But Musk has on multiple occasions highlighted Sutskever’s involvement in firing Altman, including during an interview at the New York Times Dealbook summit
“I think we should be concerned about this because I think Ilya actually has a strong moral compass,” he said. “He really sweats it over questions of what is right. And if Ilya felt strongly enough to want to fire Sam, well, I think the world should know what was that reason.”
If Sutskever were to jump ship for xAI or Tesla—or any other firm, for that matter—it would be a major development in the AI talent wars. As Musk told the Lex Fridman Podcast, Sutskever’s recruitment in 2015 “was really the linchpin for OpenAI being successful.”",finance.yahoo.com,Elon Musk says Ilya Sutskever should jump ship for Tesla

To see it, look at the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which is up more than 10% since Oct. 31 compared with the S&P 500’s 8.9% rise. In December, the equal weight version of the S&P is up 1.1% while the regular index is flat. It’s still early, but that holds it would be second-best month relative to the broader benchmark index since October 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
The move comes as the seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 by market value — Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. — waffle after dominating the market for most of 2023. Combined they account for more than a quarter of the index’s weight.
Much of the optimism for stocks more broadly is coming from investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve is done with its interest rate hikes to tame inflation and will cut rates in 2024.
“The expectation that the Fed is done raising rates has been a catalyst for investors to buy the ignored corners of the market including things like value shares and small caps,” said Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities. “This is bull-market behavior as the rally begins to broaden out and it also serves as a hedge for retail and institutional traders who want to protect their portfolios against a potential top in megacap stocks that have cooled off.”
The improved stock market breadth is also apparent in the small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index, which is up 13% since the end of October, beating the S&P 500 over that time after lagging badly through first 10 months of the year. Small- and mid-cap exchange-traded funds are also seeing stronger inflows since mid-November, according to Citigroup Inc. strategist Scott Chronert.
“You have the best of both worlds: Rates coming down will relieve pressure on small caps’ margins next year, and the economy holding together better than people thought,” said Vincent Deluard, StoneX’s director of global macro strategy.
Looking at big cap stocks, the equal weighted version of the S&P 500 is likely to outperform the cap-weighted version due to lower earnings volatility, lower valuation and less crowding, said Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian, who dubbed it the firm’s “highest conviction call.” In addition, the bank’s macroeconomic regime indicator suggests US equities are in a “recovery”, which is when the equal-weight S&P 500 typically beats the cap-weighted version, BofA data shows.
Healthy flows into large-cap equal-weight equity funds suggests that investors are using them to allocate away from traditional benchmarks due to the narrow leadership in Big Tech, said Strategas’s Sohn. Investors have poured $1.7 billion into the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) over the past month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
Now with the year coming to a close, many active managers who entered 2023 positioned for losses are trying to make up lost ground, creating even more demand for beaten-down stocks with upside.
“Active managers who broadly underperformed are trying to play catch up,” said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth.

The decision is part of a growing Nordic movement to force Tesla to sign collective bargaining agreements with Swedish mechanics, who have been on strike since October.
Labour unions in Norway and Denmark this week said they would start blocking transit shipments of Tesla cars meant for the Swedish market.
Tesla has a policy of not agreeing to collective bargaining and says its employees have as good or better terms than those the Swedish union is demanding.
""In the light of the conflict now spreading to Denmark as well as Tesla's recent very categorical refusal to enter a labour union agreement in any country, we have come to the conclusion that we as investors at present hardly can influence the company,"" the pension fund said in an emailed statement.
""That is why we're now putting Tesla on our exclusion list,"" it said.
PensionDanmark, which manages pensions for 823,000 Danes, has 317.3 billion Danish crowns ($45.81 billion) under asset management.
The fund did not say how big its holdings in Tesla are.
($1 = 6.9268 Danish crowns)

He asked her to design a logo, something simple that could be cut out and stitched easily since he was creating some apparel pieces. Carolyn was a graphic design student and he was offering her above-minimum-wage hourly pay for the design. She did some research into Greek mythology as well as simplified design and came up with a logo she thought might meet his needs. Phil didn’t really like it that much, to be honest, but it would be simple to embroider on his sporting goods. Carolyn submitted a bill for 17.5 hours of work for the design, and Phil invoiced her for the $35 he owed her at $2 per hour.
And thus, the Nike swoosh was born.
The marketing agency Rob Janoff worked for in 1977 had acquired a new client, an upstart tech company. He was tasked with creating a logo for that company, and the only guidance he received from the guy in charge over there was, “Don’t make it cute.” He went to the grocery store for some props and sat down with his sketchbook and drew, repeating the same basic shape over and over and over again until he found the simple lines of what he was seeing. He presented a few options to the company two weeks after getting the assignment and, strangely, the option with awkward rainbow colors was the one the “don’t make it cute” CEO chose. His marketing agency was paid $1,500 for the logo assignment and was contracted to use the logo in some future sales brochures.
It might be within eyesight or under the fingers of many of you right now. The bite-out-of-the-Apple logo that Rob created has graced some of the most successful computers, phones, tablets and music players ever sold.
John Pasche’s art school career in London had been going fine, three years in, when the school came to him because a group had contacted them about creating a logo. Twice John had brought drafts to the group’s frontman and twice he had turned down those efforts. In that second pitch, John came away with a piece of religious art that the group’s lead really liked and the encouragement from him, “You can really do better, John.” He honed in on some of the standout details in that art, and with his two-dimensional style, he rendered an almost obscene cartoonish logo that the group loved. He received £50 in 1970 for his two weeks’ worth of work on the logo.
The rest of the world loved the Rolling Stones’ new logo as well, and 52 years later those lips and tongue have appeared on every album the band has released and is synonymous with an era of classic rock and roll.
There is no tried-and-true way to work with a newly minted entrepreneur. Just like a pair of Nike shoes, new entrepreneurs can come in all shapes, sizes and colors. Simple, clear and bold ideas should inform a new entrepreneur’s choices, in just the way Apple has built its brand identity. And while new entrepreneurs don’t get it right on the first or second times, great things usually happen when they listen to their potential customers and keep working toward a stated goal.
The other piece that these three stories have in common, besides being wildly underpriced for the value they have provided in the long run, are the stories themselves. New businesses reach out to their friends, students and small firms with the resources at their disposal (even Apple’s $1,500 in 1977 is worth less than $8,000 today) for something as important as their logo, which will define them publicly.
Taken as stories, these anecdotes illuminate how business formation happens in the real world, in real time. They show just how important small early decisions are to the lifespan of any group. There is a quote that goes (paraphrasing), “When people think of traveling back in time, they are fearful of taking even the smallest actions for all of the drastic changes it could affect in the future. And yet people here and now do not believe that their small actions today could do the same.”
New entrepreneurs usually make tiny and small decisions at a breakneck pace during the beginning of their business journey. Those decisions have ripple effects, and the resources and partners that are accumulated during that time become forever joined with the business. Sometimes that looks like creating a bite-out-of-the-Apple logo, and sometimes that’s us sharing a new website with our social media network.
Be a part of the stories of your friends’ entrepreneurial journeys, and remember to do so when you see those iconic swooshes, fruits and lips in your daily life.
It should be easy – they’re everywhere.

Gemini has three ""sizes"" that will be available in stages: Ultra, Pro, and Nano – the last of which is designed to run locally on devices such as smartphones.
Google is giving users access to the Pro version Wednesday through its chatbot Bard, and to Cloud customers in the coming days, but says the Ultra model – the biggest and most technically advanced of the three – is still undergoing internal testing, and won't roll out until early 2024.
Google says it plans to infuse its most popular products with Gemini over time. It will also launch Gemini Ultra to a new version of Bard called Bard Advanced next year. Sissie Hsiao, Google's VP and general manager of Bard and Assistant, wouldn't say if Bard Advanced will cost money to use but didn't deny it was a possibility.
There's immense pressure on Google right now to prove it's still an AI industry leader with Gemini, which was trained to be multimodal, meaning it can process different types of media such as text, pictures, video, and audio. But Google boasts that Gemini is its ""most flexible"" model too, capable of running on a range of sources from data centers to smartphones.
In a roundtable with reporters this week, Google executives said the Ultra model of Gemini is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), a measurement that tests on subjects such as math, history, law, and ethics. The model scored 90.0%, beating OpenAI's GPT-4's 86.4%
That all sounds great, but we won't be able to test the full capabilities of Gemini just yet. Google says the Pro model outperformed GPT-3.5, which powers the free version of ChatGPT, and users will be able to test a fine-tuned version for Bard starting Wednesday (only in English to start, Google says, and not in the UK). But when asked how Gemini compares to GPT-4 overall, executives declined to comment (it did, however, benchmark Gemini Ultra against GPT-4 across a range of different areas and published the results here).
Publicly, Google has swatted away suggestions it's been scrambling to chase the competition, but things have looked very different inside the company as it has raced to get Gemini out the door and infuse AI into all of its key products.
Earlier this year, CEO Sundar Pichai merged Alphabet's prized DeepMind unit with its internal AI group, Brain, to quicken work on Gemini. Staff were also told that Google would reduce the amount of research it publishes to limit rivals commercializing their ideas, BI reported.
Where Google believes Gemini has the edge on the competition is in what it calls ""sophisticated reasoning,"" which is the way the model processes complex information across different types of media.
In one demo shown to the press, DeepMind researchers used Gemini to scour hundreds of thousands of research papers to extract specific types of data. Google said Gemini was able to distinguish between papers that were relevant to the study and those that weren't. More interestingly, they were able to show Gemini a graph with old data and have it produce an updated version, with the new data plotted.
While Gemini can process different media types, Eli Collins, VP of product for DeepMind, said the initial Gemini models won't be able to generate images and videos, but suggested this was something that would come down the line in other models.
Collins added that Google has seen some ""novel"" capabilities in Gemini that could give it an edge over rival models, but would not elaborate on what those might be.
Gemini has been trained on and is powered by tensor processing units (TPUs), and Google is using Gemini's rollout to announce its new Cloud TPU v5p and a new AI hypercomputer that will be used to improve AI training and delivery. Interestingly, Amin Vahdat, a VP at Google Cloud AI, said Gemini will run on both GPUs and TPUs in the future, but did not elaborate beyond that.
Google says it's making Gemini Pro available to enterprise customers through its Vertex AI program, and for developers in AI Studio, on December 13.
As for its consumer products beyond Bard, Google is launching Gemini Nano on the Pixel 8 Pro smartphone on Wednesday, which will enable features such as summarizing the contents of voice recordings.
Google also said it plans to add Gemini to SGE, its generative AI-powered version of Search, as well as Chrome, Duet AI, and other products, in the coming months.

"['Chris Isidore, CNN']",2023-12-06 16:50:24+00:00,,2023-12-06 15:55:13,Elon Musk is seeking to raise $1 billion for his artificial intelligence company xAI.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Felon-musk-seeking-raise-1-155513220.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_business_articles_218/1e40f2b6b63b078bfa4a8a50cd0b72b7,en,,"Elon Musk is seeking to raise $1 billion for his artificial intelligence company xAI.
The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said that it has already raised $135 million of that $1 billion target, and it has a “binding and enforceable agreement” for the purchase of the remaining shares available in this offering. In a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, last month Musk announced that investors in X Corp that he bought last year will own 25% of xAI.
The date of the the first sale of stock in the company was November 29, which was the same day that Musk appeared at the New York Times DealBook Summit. At that appearance he apologized for antisemitic tweets on his personal X account but also told advertisers which have left X because of concerns about antisemitic content on the platform to “go f**k yourself.”
Musk has been among those warning that AI could lead to “civilization destruction.” But in July he announced the creation of xAI, saying that it would “work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.”
Last month in a public conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that discussed both the dangers and opportunities of AI, Musk said that the technology could lead to a world in which no one needs to work and AI companionship would be one of the highest forms of friendship.
“AI will be a force for good most likely,” Musk said, before cautioning, “but the probability of it going bad is not zero percent.”
Tesla has its own AI efforts as part of its goals of offering self-driving cars and robots in the future. Asked by an analyst why Musk would start a separate AI company that could be seen as competing with those efforts, Musk said it was the only way to attract some of the staff he was seeking.
“There were just some of the world’s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large, sort of relatively established company like Tesla,” he said on a quarterly earnings call with Tesla investors. “So I was like, ‘Okay, well, better to start up that, that I run this, than they go work somewhere else.’ That’s kind of the genesis of xAI.”",finance.yahoo.com,Elon Musk seeking to raise $1 billion for his xAI firm,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-seeking-raise-1-155513220.html,['TSLA'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word':

If advertisers keep leaving and don't come back, can X survive?
In April, I sat down with Musk for the first of his many chaotic interviews about his acquisition of X.
He said something that, in hindsight, was rather revealing, but which passed me by at the time.
Talking about advertising, he said: ""If Disney feels comfortable advertising children's movies [on Twitter], and Apple feels comfortable advertising iPhones, those are good indicators that Twitter is a good place to advertise.""
Seven months later, Disney and Apple are no longer advertising on X - and Musk is telling companies that have left to ""Go [expletive] yourself.""
In a fiery interview on Wednesday he also used the ""b"" word - bankruptcy, in a sign of just how much the ad boycott is damaging the company's bottom line.
For a company he bought for $44bn (£35bn) last year, bankruptcy might sound unthinkable. But it is possible.
To understand why, you have to look at how reliant X is on advertising revenue - and why advertisers are not coming back.
Although we don't have the latest figures, last year around 90% of X's revenue was from advertising. It is the heart of the business.
On Wednesday Musk more than hinted at this.
""If the company fails… it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupts the company."" he said.
Mark Gay, chief client officer at marketing consultancy at Ebiquity, which works with hundreds of companies, says there is no sign anyone is returning.
""The money has come out and nobody is putting a strategy in place for reinvesting there,"" he says.
To make matters worse, on Friday retail giant Walmart announced it was no longer advertising on X.
After Musk had told advertisers who quit X where to go in Wednesday's interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, he said something that made advertisers wince even harder.
""Hi Bob"", he said - a reference to the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger.
When Musk puts chief executives ""in his crosshairs"" like this they will be even more reticent to be involved with X, says Lou Paskalis, of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory.
Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, adds: ""It doesn't take a social media expert to understand and to know that publicly and personally attacking advertisers and companies that pay X's bills is not going to be good for business.""
So could X really go bankrupt?
If advertisers are gone for good, what does Musk have?
When I interviewed him in April, it was clear he understood that subscriptions on X were not going to replace advertising money.
""If you have a million people that are subscribed for, let's say, $100 a year-ish, that's $100m. That's a fairly small revenue stream relative to advertising,"" he told me.
In 2022, Twitter's advertising revenue was around $4bn. Insider Intelligence estimates this year it will drop to $1.9bn.
Elon Musk launches profane attack on X advertisers
Elon Musk visits Israel after antisemitism row
The company has two major outlays. The first is its staffing bill. Musk has cut X to the bone already, laying off thousands.
The second is servicing the loans Musk took out to buy Twitter, totalling about $13bn. Reuters has reported that the company now has to pay $1.2bn or so in interest payments every year.
If the company cannot service the interest on its loans or afford to pay staff then, yes, X really could go bankrupt.
But that would be an extreme scenario that Musk would surely want to avoid.
He has options. By far the simplest thing for Musk would be to put more of his money in - but it sounds like he doesn't want to do that.
Musk could try to renegotiate with the banks for less onerous interest payments. He could ask, for example, for ""payment in kind"" interest - where payments are delayed.
But if renegotiation does not work and the banks don't get their money, then bankruptcy could be the only option, and at that point the banks could try to push for a change in management.
""It would be very messy and complex,"" says Jared Ellias, a professor of law at Harvard Law School. ""And it would be extremely challenging. It would create a lot of news because he would constantly get deposed and have to testify in court.""
It could be terrible for Musk's business reputation, and would also impact how Musk could borrow money in the future.
And in a bankruptcy scenario, would X simply stop working?
""I find that to be very hard to believe,"" says Ellias. ""If that happened, it'd be because Elon decided to pull the rug out. But even then, if he were to do that, the creditors would have the option of pushing the company into bankruptcy, getting a trustee appointed and turning the lights back on,"" he says.
What next for Musk?
The obvious solution to all these problems for X is to simply find another revenue stream - and fast. Musk is certainly trying.
He has launched a new audio and video calls service. Last month he streamed himself playing video games - he hopes X can compete with apps like Twitch.
He wants X to become the ""everything app"", covering everything from chat to online payments.
According to the New York Times, which got hold of the pitch deck Musk was giving to investors last year, X was supposed to bring in $15m from a payments business in 2023, growing to about $1.3bn by 2028.
X is also sitting on a huge treasure trove of data, and its vast archive of conversations can be used to train chatbots. Musk believes this data is vastly valuable.
So X does have potential.
But in the short term, none of these options plug the hole advertisers have left.
It's why Musk's profane outburst was so baffling to many.
""I don't have any theories that make sense,"" Paskalis says. ""There is a revenue model in his head that eludes me.""",finance.yahoo.com,Could X go bankrupt under Elon

McDonald's plans 10,000 new restaurants over next four years
McDonald’s, which had 40,275 restaurants globally at the start of this year, is planning to open an additional 10,000 over the next four years, according to the Associated Press.
The fast food chain has benefitted over the past decade through investment in its technology, with self-service ordering screens now the standard way to order a burger at its UK restaurants - at a time of labour shortages and a rapidly increasing minimum wage.
The McDonald’s mobile app, self-service screens and delivery services now account for more than 40pc of the sales generated by franchised and company-operated stores across its top six markets, which include the UK, according to its latest financial update.
Meanwhile, the company has indicated that it is to adopt Google’s AI technology to give restaurant workers access to a bot called Ask Pickles, which aims to give them quick answers from a wide range of manuals and data sources, helping them to fix problems quickly.
“We’re not yet leveraging the full potential of technology, nor are we leveraging the full potential of our scale,” said Brian Rice, McDonald’s chief information officer.

Oil prices continue to drop
The price of a barrel of oil has continue to fall today. Brent Crude, the benchmark measure, has falled by 3.18pc (to $74.51) as markets remain unconvinced by Opec’s attempt to keep prices high by cutting production.
Last week Opec attempted to steer prices upwards by announcing production cuts. But Angola refused to scale back supplies further and a lack of agreement meant members of the cartel were left to announce cuts on a “voluntary” basis.
As we reported earlier, American crude shipments are nearing a record six million barrels a day, according to estimates from ship-tracking firms.

Google tries to take on Microsoft with AI upgrade
Google is attempting to up the ante in its attempt to compete against Microsoft and its partner OpenAI in artificial intelligence. Today it has released a new AI model called Gemini, which will be available to customers using Google Cloud and be incorporated into its latest Pixel phones.
Gemini is being pitched as a major update which will be able to “use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions”, according to the company.
But, at a press briefing today, according to CNBC, when the company was asked whether it had any novel ability compared with other so-called “large language models”, Eli Collins, vice president at Google DeepMind, said: “I suspect it does” but that it was still working to understand this.

HS2 trains developed despite doubts over order
Taxpayers’ money is being spent developing HS2 trains despite speculation the order may be changed, MPs were told.
Nick Crossfield, managing director for manufacturer Alstom in the UK and Ireland, said “the meter is running” as he explained work is continuing at its factory in Derby to provide 54 HS2 trains based on £2bn contracts issued two years ago.
He told the Commons’ Transport Select Committee “there is a conversation to come” about how the Government’s decision to axe HS2 north of Birmingham will affect what trains are required.
A joint venture between Alstom and Hitachi Rail was awarded contracts to design, build and maintain non-tilting trains by Government-owned company HS2 Ltd.
There are suggestions the curtailment of the high-speed railway means that an order should instead be made for trains able to tilt so they can travel faster once they move onto the West Coast Main Line after reaching the West Midlands.

EU proposes three-year delay to Brexit rules to avoid electric car tariffs
The EU has officially proposed a three-year delay to tightening rules that would have led to import tariffs being imposed from next year on many electric vehicles (EVs) traded with Britain.
Britain and the European Union are each other’s largest market for exports of EVs, which are being encouraged as an alternative to carbon-emitting internal combustion engine vehicles powered by petrol or diesel.
The European Commission also said it was setting aside an extra €3bn (£2.6bn) to boost the bloc’s battery manufacturing industry, a move designed to increase local content and reduce its reliance on China.
The post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) says that, to qualify for zero tariffs, at least 55pc of the value of EVs needs to be from the European Union or Britain, with values of 65pc for battery cells and modules and 70pc for battery packs.
However, it contains two transition periods, the first with EVs requiring 40pc local content and battery packs and components 30pc, the second for 2024-2026 at 45pc for EVs, 50pc for battery cells and modules and 60pc for battery packs.
Import tariffs of 10pc apply for EVs falling short of those requirements.
The Commission’s proposal is to extend the first transition period for three years to 2027, when the full local content requirements of the TCA will apply.

Private sector hiring slows in US
Hiring in the US private sector cooled in November, as the post-pandemic boom in restaurant and hotel employment moderated, according to industry figures.
The slowdown in jobs creation is likely to be viewed favourably by policymakers at the US Federal Reserve, who are looking to cool the economy and cut inflation while avoiding a damaging recession.
Despite the Fed hiking interest rates to a 22-year high and holding them there, the jobs market has remained remarkably resilient, although it has shown some signs of cooling in recent months.
Against this backdrop, there is widespread agreement among analysts and traders that the Fed will vote to hold rates steady at its interest rate decision next week, as it continues its fight against elevated inflation.
The US private sector added 103,000 jobs in November, according to the latest ADP report.
This was lower than the 113,000 jobs created in October, and was sharply below the expectation of 127,000 new jobs predicted by Briefing.com.

Savings market becoming more competitive, says regulator
Signs of a more competitive cash savings market have been emerging, with rates increasing and savers moving their money into higher-paying fixed-term deals, according to the City regulator.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it has continued to see savers moving deposits out of easy-access accounts and into higher-paying fixed-term and notice accounts.
It wants firms to keep prompting customers in lower-paying accounts to move, and is encouraging savers to shop around.
From July to October this year, deposits held in fixed-term and notice accounts increased by £17bn.
Over the same period, deposits held in bank and building society non-interest-bearing accounts and easy-access accounts reduced by £11bn.
The average rate paid on easy-access deposits in October was 1.99pc, the FCA said, up from 1.66pc in July.
The average rate for fixed-term (which guarantee a rate for a specified period with restricted withdrawals) and notice accounts (which have a specified notice period for restricted withdrawals with a guaranteed rate) was 2.94pc in July, rising to 3.52pc in October.

Airline adverts banned over 'misleading' environmental claims
Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Etihad Airways have all had adverts banned by the UK’s regulator for giving a “misleading impression” of the airlines’ environmental impact.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ads had breached advertising rules, and “must not appear again in the form complained about”.
In the Google ads that were all seen in July, Lufthansa said people would “Fly more sustainably” with the airline. An Air France-KLM advert said it was “committed to protecting the environment” and helped people to “travel better and sustainably”.
Etihad Airways said consumers could explore the world with “Total Peace Of Mind,” while mentioning their “Environmental Advocacy”.
The ASA investigated all three ads over concerns that they gave a misleading impression of the airlines’ environmental impact.
The ASA said Etihad had removed the ad once it had been notified of the initial complaint.
Etihad had no immediate comment on Wednesday. There was no immediate comment from Air France-KLM.
Lufthansa said its ad was created by the Google Ads service and was designed to highlight a “Green Fares” option which allows passengers to offset some of their CO2 emissions.

Commuter chaos as Aslef 24-hour rail strikes hit
Some of the busiest commuter rail routes in the country had limited services or no trains at all on Wednesday because of more strikes by drivers in their long-running dispute over pay.
Members of the Aslef union at South Western Railway, Southern, Southeastern, Gatwick Express and the Isle of Wight’s Island Line walked out on Wednesday morning for 24 hours in the latest in a series of stoppages this week which are causing travel chaos.
Aslef says its members are determined to continue taking industrial action until they receive an improved pay offer on one made earlier this year of 8 per cent over two years.
Train operators and the Government are urging Aslef to put the offer to a ballot, but the union points out that its members have regularly voted to continue taking strike action.
Here is everything you need to know about the walkouts.

Pound hits three-month high against the euro as German economy struggles
The pound has hit its strongest against the euro in three months after Germany’s construction and manufacturing sectors slumped.
The euro dipped as much as 0.2pc against the pound to 85.54p, its lowest since early September, before recovering a touch to trade down 0.1pc on the day.
The move comes as German factory orders unexpectedly shrank in October, while its construction sector has fallen into a “perilous plunge” according to private sector data.
It also comes as markets increasingly bet that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates heavily next year, with traders pricing in a reduction by one and a half percentage points in 2024.
The pound was also steady against the dollar at $1.26, just about keeping in sight of last week’s near four month high of $1.2733.
Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, said: “Bank of England policy makers have been pretty consistent in saying the labour market is too tight and it’s too early to consider talking about interest rate cuts, and inflation is a bit higher in the UK than in the euro zone or the US.”
She added that as a result “the market is thinking that the ECB could be cutting rates first, then the Fed and then the Bank of England.”

Bank of England 'watching' impact of mortgages into retirement
Asked a question by our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace, deputy governor Sarah Breeden said there had been “quite an increase in the number of long dated mortgages 35 years and above”.
While this was mostly “focused on younger first time buyers”, over the last two decades their prevalence has increased across the market.

Businesses need to understand AI before using it, says Bailey
Andrew Bailey said businesses need to understand AI and its implications before using it in their operations.
The Governor of the Bank of England compared the risks associated with artificial intelligence to those experienced by investors who used algorithmic trading.
He said Britain should embrace AI “with our eyes open” and that using it without full understanding is “a recipe for trouble”.
He said it is not out of control “ in the sense of 2001 Space Odyssey” but “it is complicated” and “understanding exactly what the black box delivers can be very hard”.
He added: “If you are going to use if for real you cannot have that sort of thing happening.”

Global risks to economy have increased, warns Bailey
Andrew Bailey said global risks have also increased, pointing to the problems in China’s commercial property sector and the conflict in Gaza.
The Governor of the Bank of England said the war between Hamas and Israel has “increased uncertainty around the economic outlook, particularly with respect to energy prices”.
“If those risks crystallise, it could impact the macro economic outlook in the UK and globally,” he said.

Bailey pays tribute to 'wise and kind' Alistair Darling
Andrew Bailey ended his opening remarks with a tribute to former chancellor Alistair Darling, who died last week aged 70.
The Governor of the Bank of England said he was “wise, kind and had a wicked sense of humour”.
He said Mr Darling, who was chancellor as Britain dealt with the fallout from the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, “dealt with almost unimaginable situations in a professional way”.
He added Mr Darling “showed why preserving financial stability is so important”.

Full impact of interest rates yet to be felt, says Bailey
Governor Andrew Bailey concluded his opening remarks by saying that “while the overall risk environment has not materially changed” since the last financial stability report in July “it remains challenging”.
He added that the financial system “has so far been resilient to the impact of higher interest rates”.
However, he acknowledged that the “full impact has yet to be felt” from rates, which stand at 15-year highs of 5.25pc.

Credit lending 'subdued' as households stretched, says Bailey
Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has begun a press conference after releasing its latest financial stability report.
Looking at the credit market, he said that “overall lending remains subdued reflecting reduced demand from borrowers as well as more caution from banks over the last two years”.
He acknowledged that household finances “remain stretched by the high cost of living” and said there had been an increase in arrears for borrowers.
However, Mr Bailey said: “Mortgage arrears are likely to remain well below the 2008 peak.”

German construction in a 'perilous plunge'
Germany’s construction sector remained in a deep recession in the final quarter of the year, latest survey data showed.
The HCOB Germany Construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) showed activity fell sharply across all segments of construction, delivering a reading of 36.2 in November, which was the lowest in three-and-a-half years.
A rapid decline in housebuilding was blamed on the fall.

Housebuilding slump among fastest since 2009
House builders reported a sharp drop in activity in November as they were hit by rising borrowing costs and a fall in new projects, according to a closely-watched survey.
Construction output fell to 45.5 in November, its second lowest since May 2020 during the first Covid lockdown, according to the S&P Global/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI). A reading below 50 indicates the sector is contracting.
The industry was dragged down by housebuilding, which dropped to 39.2.

Oil edges down as US exports flood market
Oil inched down further after a four-day drop amid a flood of US exports and doubts over whether Opec+ will be able to deliver on its planned production cuts.
Global benchmark Brent traded down 0.1pc toward $77 a barrel after slumping by more than 7pc over the previous four sessions, while West Texas Intermediate was down 0.3pc close to $72.
American crude shipments are nearing a record six million barrels a day, according to estimates from ship-tracking firms.
Crude’s decline since the Opec group and its allies announced deeper output cuts on Thursday shows the market is sceptical about whether the voluntary reductions will be implemented.
Oil has dropped by almost a quarter from a peak in late September on concern increased production from outside the group will outstrip demand growth.

BAT takes £25bn hit on US cigarette brands
British American Tobacco (BAT) has said it will book a £25bn impairment charge on some of its US cigarette brands.
The tobacco giant behind Dunhill and Lucky Strike linked the charge to “the current macro-economic headwinds impacting the US combustibles industry” and its long-term strategy to shift away from traditional cigarettes.
It added: “This accounting adjustment mainly relates to some of our acquired US combustibles brands, as we now assess their carrying value and useful economic lives over an estimated period of 30 years.”
It came as the business said revenue growth for the current year is set to be at the “low end” of its 3% to 5% guidance, amid pressure on the US market.
Its shares have fallen 7.9pc.

Dax hits record high as markets bet on interest rate cuts
European shares gained on rising bets of a peak in global interest rates as Germany’s benchmark Dax scaled a fresh all-time high.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index has climbed 0.3pc, while the Germany’s DAX also rose 0.2pc to 16,564.85.
It comes as traders increase bets on interest rate cuts next year from the European Central Bank. Money markets are fully pricing in 150 basis points of cuts in 2024.
Basic resources gained 1.3pc tracking a rise in prices of most base metals.
Investors now await eurozone construction purchasing manager’s index data for November, along with October retail sales to gauge the strength of the European economy amid recession concerns.
Focus was also on US November ADP national employment report after a drop in October job openings to more than a two-and-a-half year low on Tuesday boosted expectations the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening cycle was over.

Industrial metal miners led the gains, climbing 1.8pc as prices of most base metals and iron ore rose.

Rouble lowest in a month as foreign currency sales fall
The Russian rouble fell to a more than one-month low past 93 to the dollar as it came under pressure from exporters’ reduced foreign currency sales at the start of the month.
The rouble was 0.7pc weaker against the dollar at 92.90, earlier hitting 93.04, its weakest point since November 3.
It lost 0.3pc to trade at 100.28 versus the euro, shed 0.8pc against the yuan to 12.98 and fell to 117 to the pound.
The rouble has now lost support from the month-end tax period, for which Russian exporters usually convert foreign currency into roubles.
Before last week, the currency had enjoyed seven weeks of gains. It has rebounded from more than 100 to the dollar, thanks to reduced capital outflows since President Vladimir Putin introduced the forced conversion of some foreign currency revenue for exporters in October.

The latest data show a 3.7pc decrease in demand — defying analysts who had predicted a 0.2pc gain. September’s advance, however, was revised up to 0.7pc.
The slump was driven by a 13.5pc drop in machinery and equipment that could npt offset a 20.2pc jump in new orders in the manufacture of transport equipment including aircraft, ships and trains, the statistics agency said.

Tui explores delisting from the London Stock Exchange
Tui is considering delisting from the London Stock Exchange as returns from the UK’s flagship shares index lag behind European peers.
The holiday company said it had been approached by shareholders concerned about whether its current listing is “optimal and advantageous”.
Bosses said there had been a “notable liquidity migration from UK to Germany” in the ownership of its shares over the last four years.
As a result, they will consider holding a vote on leaving the London Stock Exchange at the company’s AGM in February, instead proposing listing on Germany’s MDax market, the index directly below its flagship Dax.
The resolution would need the backing of 75pc of shareholders to take effect.
The statement said: “In light of the views expressed by shareholders and any further feedback from shareholders, the executive board is currently considering, if an upgrade to a prime standard listing in Frankfurt with MDax inclusion and a delisting from the London Stock Exchange would be in the best interest of shareholders.”
It comes a day after the Dax index in Frankfurt hit a new record high, while the FTSE 100 closed lower for a second consecutive day.
In a statement in the company’s full year results, bosses said:

Good morning
Thanks for joining me. Tui is considering delisting from the London Stock Exchange and moving its shares to Germany after concerns were raised by shareholders about where they could get the highest returns.

Rueger, who is based in New York, will join Gareth McCartney in the role, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing confidential information. Jeff Mortara, currently McCartney’s global co-head of ECM, is set to pursue other opportunities either within UBS or externally, the people said.
The appointment comes as UBS bolsters the ranks of its US investment bank, one of the people said.
Rueger was earlier this year named vice chairman at JPMorgan after previously holding the role of head of health-care ECM. He has worked at the US lender since 1997, his LinkedIn profile shows.
Spokespeople for UBS and JPMorgan declined to comment.

Wonder if you’re missing out on any other everyday items at home to sell for extra cash? Personal finance expert Rachel Cruze addressed this topic on her YouTube channel and recommended selling these 15 items in your home to make money.

1. Old Televisions
If you have an extra television in good condition, Cruze said you can still make money from selling it.
This is true of even older television models. Cruze uses the example of how she spotted a 2005 Toshiba TV on eBay on sale for $150.

2. Computers
Much like televisions, it’s possible someone is interested in purchasing your old computer. However, Cruze said the computer must be in good condition for a successful sale.
3. Cell Phones
If you recently upgraded your smartphone, consider selling the old model. How much can you get for selling one? According to Cruze, a preowned, unlocked iPhone 6s in good condition sold on eBay can sell from anywhere between $75 to $114.
The sales aren’t just limited to smartphones either. Older cell phones in good condition attract buyers, too. Cruze also spotted a Nokia flip phone for sale on eBay for $66.
4. Unused Gift Cards
Another way to make money is by selling any unused gift cards you have at home.
However, there are a lot of gift card scams running rampant online. These scams can make it difficult for strangers to get on board with purchasing the gift cards you have for sale, even if you’re a reputable seller. The best approach is to take the gift cards you do have at home and turn their unused balances into cash. According to CNBC, you can do this on reputable websites like Raise and CardCash and pick your payout method.
5. Vinyl Records and Turntables
Vintage records and turntables in great condition are always hot items to sell for money. Cruze recommends doing your research on the artist, the year and the type of record you plan to sell to see if it’s rare.
6. Furniture
If you have some furniture you don’t use in your basement or garage, consider selling it. This is especially true of bigger pieces which may be bulky and taking up a lot of space.
“Furniture is a great source of cash if it’s in good, quality condition,” said Cruze, adding you may be able to make a little more money off of any furniture made in the 1980s or 1990s.
7. Vintage Clothes
Search the closets of older family members (with their permission to do so, of course) and see if there are any vintage clothes you can sell. Who knows: You might find designer threads with a significantly high resale value.
8. Musical Instruments
If your kids tried playing a musical instrument, like a guitar or drums, and gave up after a few practices, chances are you still have these instruments stored in your home.
Consider pricing and selling them. Cruze said guitars and drums which are in good condition can sell for over $100.
9. Jewelry
A common misconception of selling jewelry is thinking you can only do it if you have something valuable to sell, like diamonds or gold. This is not true.
Cruze recommends looking at your watches, chains and charm bracelets. Whatever jewelry you decide to sell should not be sentimental pieces or anything you frequently wear.
10. Books
After conducting a quick Google search, you may be surprised to find out how much the books in your home are worth. You can sell them on platforms like Pangobooks, Mercari and eBay — or if you’re OK accepting a lower price, take them down to your local bookstore and see what they’ll pay you for them.
11. Typewriters
Like selling vinyl records and turntables, typewriters are a trendy, vintage item worth selling if they’re in good condition.
12. Kids’ Toys
Think less actual toys and more collectible merchandise. Some of these items may include, but are not limited to, Pokémon cards, Barbie dolls, action figures and comic books. Do your research to see what each item is worth and set your prices accordingly. Cruze said bonus points go to households with vintage video games or arcade games which are in high demand with sellers.
13. Old Coins
If you want to unload old, rare coins, it is best to do it with places which allow you to convert the coins into spendable cash. Some of GOBankingRates’ recommendations include Heritage Auctions, Stack’s Bowers Galleries or by making a visit to your local coin dealer.
14. VHS Tapes and Cassette Tapes
Chances are high your home has at least a box or two of these tapes lying around. Consider selling them to buyers who collect these tapes.
15. Any Other Vintage or Antique Items
According to Cruze, anything older than 20 years is considered vintage and may be worth a lot of cash. Anything over 100 years is considered an antique and may be worth even more money.
However, you don’t need to have a lot (or any) vintage items in your home to make money. If you have a lot of good-quality items in your home you don’t use and are willing to sell them, doing so can help you earn extra money.

In a letter published Wednesday, US Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon asked the Justice Department to allow the technology companies to discuss the practice publicly. The Democrat said the companies previously told him that the “practice is restricted from public release by the government.”
The senator’s letter didn’t specify which governments have sought notification data from Apple and Google, but indicated that they are foreign entities.
After the publication of the letter, Apple confirmed it does receive such requests from foreign governments. The US federal government “prohibited us from sharing any information,” the company said. “Now that this method has become public, we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”
Both Apple and Google have their own so-called push notification systems that provide instant alerts for everything from text messages to bank deposits to sports scores. The companies deliver billions of notifications to users each month, and the systems are used by millions of third-party developers.
Notification data — if obtained by a government — could reveal a user’s habits, communications and whereabouts. They’re potentially some of the most private pieces of information sent to a person’s smartphone, tablet or computer.
“As with all of the other information these companies store for or about their users, because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information,” Wyden wrote. “Importantly, app developers don’t have many options; if they want their apps to reliably deliver push notifications on these platforms, they must use the service provided by Apple or Google.”
In response to the letter, Google said it has already been publishing transparency reports that share “the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden.”
“We share the senator’s commitment to keeping users informed about these requests,” the company said in a statement.
Both companies said they have in-depth processes for either accepting or rejecting government requests. And Apple now plans to break out the push notification requests it receives in its next transparency report.
“Apple is committed to transparency, and we have long been a supporter of efforts to ensure that providers are able to disclose as much information as possible to their users,” the company said.
Reuters previously reported on Wyden’s letter.

""I have every confidence that between all of our colleagues around the world, we will invent technologies, philosophies, methodologies, practices, monitors, regulations, design practices, to keep technology safe,"" founder, President and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang told the BBC at a roundtable interview on Wednesday.
His comments come a month after artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI descended into chaos, during which founder Sam Altman was sacked by the board, and then re-instated after an uproar.
During the drama at the company, which operates the large language model ChatGPT, a spotlight was shone on how commercial competition is shaping the development of AI systems and the pace at which the technology is moving.
However, top investor Microsoft denied it was due to a disagreement over safety.
ChatGPT, was in fact, trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.
The demand for its AI chips has pushed Nvidia's share price more than threefold, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
In May the firm joined technology giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of companies with stock market valuations of more than $1 trillion (£822bn).
But the company is not alone in its pursuit of the AI chip businesses - Chinese telecoms firm Huawei has said it intends to make AI an integral part of its strategy, with its CFO Meng Wanzhou saying it wants to provide the world with a ""second option"".
But Mr Huang says he is not phased by such competition, saying it is good for the advancement of the technology.
""It allows us to do our best work and make contributions to society,"" said the chips founder, who is estimated to have a net worth of $41.6bn, according to Forbes.
Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower
The US is beating China in the battle for chips
The chip designer dominates more than 90% of China's $7bn (£8.8bn) AI chip market, and Mr Huang acknowledged that historically around 20% of its revenue came from China.
But in its November earnings report, Nvidia warned that it expects a fall in sales towards the end of the year because of US export restrictions aimed at curbing China's advancement in the field.
The US said the measures were designed to prevent China from receiving cutting-edge technologies that it could use to strengthen its military, especially in the field of AI.
Nvidia is working closely with the US government, Mr Huang said, to make sure chips for the Chinese market are fully compliant with the current rules.
What does the future hold?
Despite relations between China and the US deteriorating in recent years, the Asia-Pacific region is central to Nvidia's supply chain.
Its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has 35,000 parts, according to Mr Huang, with chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, memory chips from South Korea, packaging technology from Japan and technologies that power the chips from the United States.
""This is the most sophisticated computer in the world. It's kind of a technology miracle.""
There is a recognition that AI is no longer just an opportunity, but that it is strategically vital, Mr Huang added, revealing that Nvidia is working with the Singapore government on a large language model called Sealion, as well as the country's overall AI strategy - and planned to make big investments there.
Mr Huang added that Singapore is a growing market for his company because of the 1,100 AI start-ups based there and its role as a data centre hub for the region, but also because it is home to venture capitalists that fund the AI ecosystem.
""Once we have that language, once we have that foundation, the Singapore foundation, then the rest of the industries, the rest of society, the rest of competition, can then build upon that,"" he said.
""The first wave was the American internet companies. The second wave are now the world's countries. Each one of the countries wants to build its own foundation to support its start-ups, its own companies, its own industries. And so now now we're seeing globally, the need to replicate what happened in the United States.""",finance.yahoo.com,Nvidia boss Jensen Huang confident about AI

['Matthew Fox'],2023-12-06 19:20:27+00:00,,2023-12-06 19:00:01,More than $170 billion worth of company mergers have been announced since the FTC lost its high-profile case to block the Microsoft/Activision merger.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fsure-looks-corporate-america-isnt-190001023.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T.D2GsuKjQnQV4ixZTLppg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/6bd83ecc78e188d2815fca5f48c113e9,en,,"A slew of recent merger announcements suggests companies aren't afraid to test the Biden administration's antitrust agenda.
More than $170 billion worth of company mergers have been announced since October.
FTC Chair Lina Khan has been vocally against big corporate deals, but recently failed to prevent Microsoft from buying Activision Blizzard.
It doesn't seem like the Biden Administration's antitrust stance is doing much to deter companies from testing the waters with a slew of mega-mergers.
Since September, there's been a spate of merger announcements totaling more than $170 billion across different sectors, and the failure of Federal Trade Commission chief Lina Khan to stop Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard appears to have further opened the floodgates.
Over the weekend it was announced that Alaskan Airlines would buy Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal. That follows reports last week that health insurance giants Cigna and Humana would merge in a deal worth more than $60 billion.
The list goes on: Cisco is pursuing a $28 billion merger with cyber-security firm Splunk, Chevron announced a $59 billion deal to acquire Hess, and Exxon Mobil is attempting to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for $68 billion.
The FTC chief early on had made antitrust among tech firms in particular a focus for her agency. But there doesn't seem to be much concern among these companies, according to Wall Street analysts.
""Big tech went from fearing Kahn and the FTC to viewing them like a mosquito, and we believe there's going to be a tidal wave of M&A ahead as there's no longer worries about Kahn and the FTC stopping anything after what's been a debacle 18 months for the Kahn administration,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Business Insider in an interview on Monday.
More deals are especially likely if the stock market continues to move higher and interest rates move lower. Companies can use their juiced up stock price as currency to help fund potential takeovers, and lower interest rates means lower funding costs for a deal if a company funds it with debt.
A particularly brazen move
The potential Cigna-Humana deal would be a particularly brazen move, coming in an election year and in an industry that already faces plenty of scrutiny from both the public and politicians. And yet, the fact that it could be attempted at all shows just how emboldened corporations have become, despite the anti-monopoly rhetoric that's come out of Khan's FTC and the Biden White House.
""The key factor is how Lina Khan at the FTC will view the merger,"" Third Bridge senior analyst George Congdon told Business Insider. ""The two companies are valued at $83 billion and $60 billion respectively, which will likely draw scrutiny from hawkish regulators. Our experts were dubious as to whether Humana would be allowed to buy Cigna's Medicare Advantage business, let alone embark on a fully fledged merger,""
Alaska Airline's buy of Hawaiian Airlines is another high profile deal in an industry already plagued by issues critics say stem from a lack of competition. Alaskan Airline's CEO appears confident that the deal will be seen as a boon for customers.
""This is definitely pro-consumer,"" Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told CNBC on Monday, adding that it should expand the airline's domestic and international footprint. ""We will become the bigger, stronger carrier to compete against the big four that control 80% of the domestic market share. We feel that we check both those boxes and we're hopeful that [the deal] will be seen in a positive light.""
Whether Khan and her FTC, or the Department of Justice, will see it that way remains to be seen. The DOJ is currently in the middle of a lawsuit to prevent JetBlue from acquiring Spirit Airlines, and Khan has remained steadfast in her anti-trust stance during her term as Chair of the FTC, despite some high-profile setbacks.
""We only bring lawsuits where we believe there's a law violation and where we think we can win,"" Khan told Bloomberg last month. And in a recent interview with DealBook, Khan defended the FTC's record under her leadership.
Khan said the FTC has levied lawsuits against 11 potential mergers, and in five of those instances the companies dropped their merger plans. She also said 14 potential mergers were dropped during the FTC's investigation periods.
The dollar value of completed mergers in the US has fallen dramatically since its peak of more than $2 trillion in 2021. So far this year, only $634 billion in merger deals have been completed, according to data from Bloomberg.
But that steep decline in deal flow since 2021 is more likely because of the surge in interest rates throughout 2022 and a stumbling stock market, and less likely to do with the intense scrutiny of Khan's FTC.
If interest rates continue to fall and the cost of capital for companies to pursue deals declines, it's possible that corporate America will continue to challenge the Biden administration and test the waters with more M&A in 2024, as President Biden might feel pressure to toe a fine line between pro-business and anti-monopoly in his bid for re-election.",finance.yahoo.com,It sure looks like

At an event Wednesday held in San Jose, California, Su unveiled a long-anticipated lineup called the MI300, taking aim at an industry dominated by Nvidia Corp. That forecast is more than twice as high as the one AMD gave in August, showing how rapidly expectations are changing for artificial intelligence hardware.
The launch is one of the most important in AMD’s 50-year history, setting up a showdown with Nvidia in the red-hot market for AI accelerators. Such chips help develop AI models by bombarding them with data, a task they handle more adeptly than traditional computer processors.
AMD is showing increasing confidence that the MI300 lineup can win over some of the biggest names in technology, potentially diverting billions in spending toward the company. Companies using the processors will include Microsoft Corp., AMD said.
The new chip has more than 150 billion transistors and 2.4 times as much memory as Nvidia’s H100, the current market leader. It also has 1.6 as much memory bandwidth, further boosting performance, AMD said.
Su said that the new chip is equal to Nvidia’s H100 in its ability to train AI software and much better at inference — the process of running that software — once it’s ready for real-world use.
Nvidia shares dipped 1.3% to $459.61 in New York on Wednesday, while AMD’s stock was little changed.

The iPhone maker said in a statement it “took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.” It added that “these techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.”
The company said it would continue to make changes in the future to protect its users. The announcement comes a day after Beeper Mini, the latest app to enable iMessage on Android devices, stopped working. Apple’s iMessage offers encrypted messaging between iPhones, Macs, iPads and other devices made by the company, and it has resisted calls for nearly a decade to expand the service to Android.
Some users have long argued that the lack of an iMessage app for Android makes messaging between the two platforms less secure. Apple recently said it would support RCS, or rich communication services, later next year. That’s a replacement for the standard SMS service that will enable an improved texting experience between platforms.

Beeper was founded by Eric Migicovsky, who is known for creating the Pebble smartwatch in the years before the Apple Watch and for being part of Y Combinator, the tech industry’s most prestigious business incubator.
In an interview, Migicovsky said his new company continues to work on Beeper Mini and is “feeling good” about again bypassing Apple’s restrictions. He said that Beeper Cloud — a variant of Beeper Mini — is still working. Beeper Mini, he says, is more secure and connects directly to Apple services, while Beeper Cloud uses third-party servers.
“The passion and energy people had this week is indicative of the importance of what we’re doing,” Migicovsky said. He denied that Beeper Mini creates security issues for users, saying his app enables encrypted messaging between Android and iOS so less security is a false notion.
Migicovsky, who said he hasn’t heard from Apple about his service, was selling Beeper Mini for a $1.99 per month subscription after a one week free trial. Apple doesn’t charge a subscription to use iMessage on its devices.
Apple said it can’t verify that messages sent through unauthorized systems that masquerade the use of Apple credentials are actually end-to-end encrypted. Other services, including one called Sunbird, have previously tried to make iMessage work on Android. Those efforts were also shuttered by Apple.
Despite adding support for RCS next year, Apple executives have publicly and privately shot down the idea of making it easier for iOS and Android users to communicate. Last year, Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook suggested that a user who wanted to more easily message with his mother on Android buy her an iPhone.
Craig Federighi, Apple’s software engineering chief, said in an email to fellow executives several years ago that “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.”
The company’s operating systems will further open up next year in the European Union with the Digital Markets Act, which will require Apple to allow third-party app stores in the region.

GM doesn't want CarPlay
According to a report from Motortrend, GM's head of product for infotainment, Tim Babbitt, blames safety for why CarPlay and other third-party systems needed to go. For some reason, Babbitt thinks that the systems provided by Apple and Google are unreliable and force users to seek out their device to complete a task while driving.
In an incredible stretch of logic, Babbitt claims GM's solution cuts the smartphone from the equation entirely, and is therefore safer.
When GM initially announced the move to ditch CarPlay, it was emphasizing in-car subscription services it could sell to customers as a way to drive revenue after a sale. The pitch didn't mention safety as an issue until now when the shift away from CarPlay is not only happening, it's incredibly controversial.
GM is abandoning user choice by implementing an infotainment system that requires users to opt into GM's custom Android-based operating system. Subscription revenue to premium services plus unprecedented access to user data, which can be monetized, drive GM's move.
Crying ""safety"" isn't only a joke -- it's an insult to the industry.
GM's safety problem
GM's leadership seems to believe that an infotainment system divorced from the driver's device will promote safety when it is sure to do the opposite. Customers who can't access CarPlay or Android Auto will likely revert to using Bluetooth to control media or make calls.
This is GM's alternative to CarPlay. Source: Motortrend
In GM's ""safer"" world, where it controls the infotainment system and gets to rake in subscription revenue, drivers will need to fumble around for their iPhones to perform tasks that typically appear on a touch display. Thinking otherwise is naive.
A person's smartphone has their contact database, favorite apps, saved data like frequent locations, and much more. GM expecting people to upload their contacts and maintain a separate information database like it's 2006 is frankly out of touch.
GM's complaints are issues of its own making
The driving force behind Babbitt's comment about safety is the concept that Android Auto and CarPlay ""aren't perfect programs."" He points to stability issues that ""manifest themselves as bad connections, poor rendering, slow responses, and dropped connections.""

Apple CarPlay has existed since 2014. It runs as a program on top of the vehicle's infotainment system to bring apps and data from the iPhone to the vehicle's display.
CarPlay can be navigated through touch or, on older models, physical controls like knobs and buttons. The speed at which operations occur and how well touch input is received depends almost entirely on the manufacturer, not the iPhone.
We admit CarPlay isn't perfect. Older iPhones may run into performance issues over time, but connecting to CarPlay is hardly an intensive task. The fault usually lies in cheap processors driving the infotainment systems, terrible touch displays that fail to respond, or software that struggles to render CarPlay.",finance.yahoo.com,"GM ditching

['David Meyer'],2023-12-06 19:55:12+00:00,,2023-12-06 17:16:13,"Welcome to the inevitable consequences of the ""fair share"" telecoms concept.",https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitch-exits-south-korea-over-171613373.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jEH0A7vsyCm8_SjhFYn1Ew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/f91099e9d3447a3651025da81b145061,en,,"The e-sports streamer Twitch is pulling out of South Korea because it’s gotten “prohibitively expensive” to run its service there. The Amazon-owned platform will stop serving the country on Feb. 27.
Welcome to the inevitable consequences of the so-called “fair share” concept in telecommunications, which I’ve already written about a couple of times this year—EU digital chief Thierry Breton, a former telecoms CEO, ran a consultation about introducing it in Europe, only to back off when almost everyone who wasn’t a big telco said it was a terrible idea.
The “fair share” argument goes roughly like this: Maintaining and upgrading telecom networks is expensive, so the biggest online service providers, whose growing data volumes necessitate the upgrades, ought to bear some of the costs. Critics have consistently pointed out that this is effectively a “sender-pays” proposal that flies in the face of the net-neutrality principle—which says network providers should treat all content equally—and that end users already pay the network providers for carrying the traffic, so the telcos are just trying to double-charge.
India and Brazil are currently considering implementing ""fair share,"" but South Korea, which led the way in 2016, is still the only country that’s actually introduced it. Korea Telecom has used the principle to extract large fees from foreign providers in particular. South Koreans have already suffered deteriorating service quality as a result, with Facebook having routed its Korean users to caches in other countries, to avoid paying KT for the privilege of running a cache in its network—the resulting quadrupling of latency prompted KT to complain that Facebook was playing hardball in fee negotiations, only for a court to rule that Facebook could route its traffic as it pleases.
Which brings us back to Twitch’s exit from the market. Twitch already lost some popularity when, due to those high network usage costs, it last year downgraded its video resolution to 720p. According to a blog post from CEO Dan Clancy yesterday, that wasn’t enough: “While we have lowered costs from these efforts, our network fees in Korea are still 10 times more expensive than in most other countries. Twitch has been operating in Korea at a significant loss, and unfortunately there is no pathway forward for our business to run more sustainably in that country.”
This doesn’t smell like a fee-negotiating tactic. Clancy wrote that Twitch will “work to help Twitch streamers in Korea move their communities to alternative livestreaming services in Korea,” and is “reaching out to several of these services to help with the transition and will communicate with impacted streamers as those discussions progress.” You don’t actively hand your customers over to your rivals (in this case, YouTube and local player AfreecaTV) if you plan on coming back.
“Twitch is the most established gaming and streaming community, and to be losing it is unfathomable,” livestreamer Alexandria Brooks, an American in South Korea, told the New York Times.
Sadly it's all too fathomable. This entirely predictable mess should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who feels like subverting how the internet works—hope you’re watching, India and Brazil. More news below.

"['Leo Sun, The Motley Fool']",2023-12-13 11:19:54+00:00,,2023-12-13 10:35:00,The software maker and Bitcoin hoarder faces unpredictable long-term challenges.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fmarket-crash-could-come-microstrategy-103500851.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/d5335543053f6106f63f3c2e79b95ffc,en,,"2022 was a brutal year for stocks as inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro challenges rattled the markets. Many of the stocks that were punished last year bounced back in 2023 as some of those headwinds stabilized, but the market could be due for another pullback in 2024 after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose by about 20% and 30%, respectively, over the past 12 months.
If the market plunges again next year, its more speculative stocks could be the first to tumble. One of those is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which saw its stock price nearly triple over the past 12 months as the value of its Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) holdings rose.
What does MicroStrategy do?
MicroStrategy was founded 34 years ago as a data mining and analytics company. It went public in 1998, and its stock soared from its split-adjusted IPO price of $60 to a record high of $3,130 near the apex of the dot-com bubble in early 2000.
But that bubble burst shortly after MicroStrategy's stock peaked, and the stock's decline was exacerbated by the unexpected restatement of its financial results for the previous two years. Those sudden revisions prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a probe into the company that eventually ended in a settlement.
Over the two decades that followed, MicroStrategy divested itself of some of its businesses and expanded its software into the mobile and cloud markets. However, the aging software company faced fierce competition from higher-growth analytics companies like Salesforce as well as expanding cloud infrastructure giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
From a software maker to a Bitcoin hoarder
From 2010 to 2020, MicroStrategy's revenue only grew at a compound annual rate of 0.6%. It also turned unprofitable in 2020. That's why it might seem odd that its stock surged 172% in 2020.
That rally was completely driven by the company's abrupt decision to hoard Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency's price skyrocketed. It initially bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin in August 2020 and continued to purchase more over the following three years.
MicroStrategy's revenue rose by 6% to $511 million in 2021 as its software business stabilized in a post-pandemic market. However, its net loss widened from $7.5 million in 2020 to $535.5 million in 2021 as its Bitcoin impairment losses surged.
Bitcoin's price peaked at more than $65,000 in November 2021. But by the end of 2022, its price had dropped to about $16,000 as inflation, rising interest rates, and a marketwide shift away from risk assets crushed the cryptocurrency market. However, MicroStrategy was still holding 132,500 Bitcoin that it had acquired for an aggregate cost of $4 billion and at an average price of $30,100 per Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, MicroStrategy's core software business stayed sluggish as declining product license and support revenues offset its rising subscription revenue. As a result, its revenue fell by 2% to $499 million in 2022 and its net loss widened to $1.47 billion. Most of that loss was attributed to its $1.29 billion in Bitcoin impairment charges.
Does Bitcoin's rebound make MicroStrategy a buy?
MicroStrategy seemed to be on the ropes last year, but Bitcoin's recovery to about $42,000 brought back the bulls. By the end of Q3 2023, the company was holding 158,400 Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $29,586 with a market value of $4.7 billion. That's half the company's current enterprise value of $9.4 billion -- so if the token resumes its climb, that could certainly drive MicroStrategy's stock higher.
Its software business is also growing again. Its total revenue rose 1% year over year to $371.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 as its 38% growth in subscription revenue offset the declines in its product license and support revenues. It also generated a net profit of $340 million, compared to a net loss of $1.22 billion a year earlier, and its digital impairment losses declined 93% year over year.
For the full year, analysts expect MicroStrategy's revenue to rise 1% to $505 million as it generates a net profit of $334 million. But based on those estimates and its current enterprise value, it still doesn't seem like a bargain at 19 times this year's sales. Its high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.0 could also limit its potential for further share price gains as long as interest rates stay elevated.
Those weaknesses, along with management's odd decision to mix a slow-growth software business with a volatile Bitcoin-hoarding one, will likely make the stock an easy target for the bears if the market crashes again. So for now, I'd simply invest in higher-growth tech stocks or buy Bitcoin instead of betting on MicroStrategy's unbalanced approach to both markets.

Bill Gates said the world probably won’t meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping temperature rise below 2C. But he praised the COP28 summit for making progress on tackling climate change despite geopolitical tensions.
“Climate progress is moving ahead even though we won't meet our highest aspirations,” he said in Bloomberg TV, citing the biggest-ever attendance at the annual United Nations summit and announcements on food and health initiatives.
Keeping warming to 2C, the weaker goal agreed on at COP21 in Paris, “isn’t that likely,” he said. ""Fortunately, if you stay below 3C, a lot of the ill effects that people have heard about don't happen.”
A planet that warms by 3C from pre-industrial levels could regularly expose up to 50 million people to temperatures that are beyond human survivability, a 2018 study in Lancet Planetary Health showed. New York City might experience three once-in-a-century flooding events every year while as many as 52 times more people would face dangerous heat in African cities. The amount of land destroyed by wildfires globally would double and the Amazon rainforest would turn into grassland.

Gates cited nuclear fusion and fission as well as green steel as being among the solutions he’s optimistic about. The Microsoft Corp. co-founder, who invests in dozens of clean-technology companies through his Breakthrough Energy Ventures, said that meetings on the sidelines of COP28 are crucial for startups to get exposure to large players in industries that need to decarbonize, such as cement.
This year’s summit, hosted by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, has faced controversy for its embrace of the fossil fuel industry. Sultan Al Jaber, the oil executive overseeing the talks, argues that they need to be engaged in the conversation. Those who want a quicker move away from dirty energy say the industry is doing far too little to shift to alternatives.

""We have to outcompete fossil fuels,” Gates said. “To do that properly, they shouldn’t get subsidies and in fact a carbon tax over time should be put on.”

But the data also found that roughly one in six teens describe their use of two platforms — YouTube and TikTok — as “almost constant.”
Seventy-one percent of teens said they visit YouTube at least daily; 16% described their usage as “almost constant"" according to the survey. A slightly larger group — 17% — said they used TikTok almost constantly. Those figures for Snapchat and Instagram came in at 14% and 8% respectively.
YouTube remains by far the most popular social platform among teens, with 93% responding that they use the service. That number was down two percentage points from 2022. Runners-up included TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram, although all three trailed YouTube in this measure by 30 percentage points or more. Three of those four platforms showed slight drops in usage over the past year, according to the survey. The exception, Snapchat, rose a single percentage point.
Facebook, whose overall usage by teens has dropped to 33% in 2023 from 71% in 2014-15, gets about the respect from teens you’d expect. Only 19% of teens reported checking Facebook daily or more frequently. Just 3% describe their usage as almost constant.
Social media is increasingly taking fire over the algorithmic techniques that platforms use to drawn in and retain younger users. In October, a coalition of 33 states, including New York and California, sued Meta Platforms for contributing to the youth mental health crisis, alleging that the company knowingly and deliberately designed features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. Meta has denied the charges.
The Pew survey, which was published Monday, was conducted from Sept. 26 to Oct. 23 with 1,453 teens aged 13 to 17.",finance.yahoo.com,"Pew survey: YouTube tops teens' social-media diet, with roughly a

Documents posted Wednesday by by U.S. safety regulators say the company will send out a software update to fix the problems.
The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly.
The agency says its investigation found Autopilot's method of ensuring that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and “can lead to foreseeable misuse of the system.”
The recall covers nearly all of the vehicles Tesla sold in the U.S. and includes those produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7 of this year.
The software update includes additional controls and alerts “to further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility,” the documents said.
The software update was sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday, with the rest getting it at a later date, the documents said.
Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when it’s not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on City Streets.
The software update apparently will limit where Autosteer can be used.
“If the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage,” the recall documents said.
Recall documents say that agency investigators met with Tesla starting in October to explain “tentative conclusions” about the fixing the monitoring system. Tesla, it said, did not agree with the agency's analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the investigation.
Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether a driver's hands are on the steering wheel.
Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane, but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name. Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool, so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even sitting in the back seat.
In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said Autopilot's controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse.”
A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the Austin, Texas, company.
Tesla says on its website that Autopilot and a more sophisticated Full Self Driving system cannot drive autonomously and are meant to help drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. Full Self Driving is being tested by Tesla owners on public roads.
In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged.
NHTSA has dispatched investigators to 35 Tesla crashes since 2016 in which the agency suspects the vehicles were running on an automated system. At least 17 people have been killed.
The investigations are part of a larger probe by the NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations, including a recall of Full Self Driving software.
In May, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department includes NHTSA, said Tesla shouldn’t be calling the system Autopilot because it can’t drive itself.
In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the Tesla investigation remains open “as we monitor the efficacy of Tesla’s remedies and continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of safety.”",finance.yahoo.com,Tesla recalls over 2 million vehicles to fix defective system that monitors drivers using Autopilot,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-recalls-over-2-million-102948044.html,['TSLA'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'DETROIT', 'normalized': 'DETROIT', 'company_key': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 7, 'score': 0.9933512210845941}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'AP', 'normalized': 'AP', 'company_key': None, 'start': 9, 'end': 11, 'score': 0.9961137771606441}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Tesla', 'normalized': 'TSLA', 'company_key': 'TSLA', 'start': 15, 'end': 20, 'score': 0.9913408756256101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Autopi', 'normalized': 'Autopi', 'company_key': None, 'start': 182, 'end': 188, 'score': 0.8670499324798581}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##lot', 'normalized': '##lot', 'company_key': None, 'start': 188, 'end': 191, 'score': 0.48621475696563704}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'U.

Adam Beswick from Lancashire found fame on the site when he started advertising his books under the hashtag.
Kirsty McKay, owner of The Book Dragon in Stockton, said #BookTok was allowing self-published authors to thrive.
#BookTok has over 200 billion views on TikTok, the equivalent of everyone in the world viewing it 25 times.
It has become a community of book lovers sharing favourite reads and reviews, as well as a place for authors to share upcoming work.
Mr Beswick's popularity on TikTok was kickstarted when his self-published book, A Forest of Vanity and Valour, went viral on the short-form video app before becoming the number one folklore bestseller on Amazon in 2022.
He said: ""#BookTok has quite literally changed my life.
""It's coming up for two years since my first book came out and I've just released the sixth book in that series.""
Prior to becoming a self-published author two years ago, Mr Beswick was working as a nurse.
Now he is a full-time author with his own publishing brand, meaning he has full control over his books, their content, the cover, design and marketing.
'Quite surreal'
With more than 971,000 likes on TikTok and 200,000 followers on Instagram, Mr Beswick, from Oswaldtwistle, said social media had become an ever-growing community that had made book marketing a lot easier, and meant self-published books were more accessible to people.
""TikTok is what kickstarted everything for me. It allowed me to get those foundations to start building my reader base and start not being afraid of putting my books out there,"" he said.
""It's been an amazing two years, quite surreal.""
The #BookTok community started building on TikTok during the Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.
Colleen Hoover is arguably one of the community's most successful authors.
Her book, It Ends With Us, was published in 2016 but went viral on TikTok in 2021, turning it into the New York Time's number one bestseller in 2022.
It is now being turned into a movie with the cast including Hollywood stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.
As of October 2022, Ms Hoover has sold more than 20 million books, according to the New York Times.
Kirsty McKay founded The Book Dragon, which prides itself in only selling self-published books.
Two weeks after taking her own book to a High Street bookshop, Kirsty said she found it stacked in the furthest bookcase away from the front with only the spine showing.
There was absolutely no chance of a customer ever seeing it, she said.
""There's no support, no interest for self-published authors. You think writing the book is the hardest bit, but it's not. It's the actual marketing and promotion of it,"" she said.
""#BookTok is raising awareness of books that people wouldn't necessarily know about, because it's very difficult as a self-published author to market, as we pay all our own expenses from writing the book to editing it.""
Kirsty explained the reason #BookTok was so popular was because people were always looking for a community, adding: ""Certainly writers are looking for other writers that they can share their knowledge with, their experiences, hints and tips.""
She said: ""For people who want to start writing, tapping into that community will give them all sorts of advice and experience, and maybe the confidence to actually give it a go.

In May 2020, a Nielsen Book survey reported that 41% of UK adults were reading more than in pre-pandemic times.
The National Literary Trust then revealed in July 2020 that more than a third of children and young people were reading more.
This growth in reading was seen alongside the increasing popularity of TikTok.

The agency has been investigating the electric automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years on whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the driver assistance system.
Tesla's Autopilot is intended to enable cars to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane, while enhanced Autopilot can assist in changing lanes on highways.
The agency said there may be an increased risk of a crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.
The company will roll out the update to certain Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicles as a remedy, the agency said.
The world's most valuable automaker, whose shares were down 1% in premarket trading, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

I can see the folder names, but the check boxes have an arrow in them. When I try to open a folder, I get a message that it may have been changed or moved. I don't think I moved or changed anything.
— John P.,

A: Oh, my, where to start, John? First of all, I am strongly of the opinion that your blame for the problem you’re describing is incorrectly being laid on the shoulders of Dell and their firmware update. What you’re describing is an issue with the Windows file system. Although files do reside on media that is accessed through the firmware, this is an electrical connection, and firmware manages the low-level communication protocol that the system CPU uses to access the storage. The actual implementation of the files and folders is wholly managed by Windows. A firmware update should not get in the way of that process.
It's actually surprisingly easy to accidentally change something in Windows without knowing it. But it’s even easier for Microsoft to make changes through Windows Update. Since it doesn’t ask you for permission — even for changes that can have a significant effect on how your system operates — something could easily have been changed without you knowing about it.
I’m curious about your description that “check boxes have an arrow in them.” There is a little-used feature in the Windows File Browser that puts a checkbox next to each file, presumably to make it easier to select files, and to tell which files are selected. I turned on check boxes (in File Explorer: View → Show → Item check boxes) and did some experimenting. I was unable to recreate any view where there was an arrow in a checkbox. I was, however, able to create two distinct arrows on the file icon itself.
The first kind is blue double arrows facing each other. It appears in the upper-right corner of the icon. When you see this, it is an indication that the file, folder or entire disk is compressed. This is a Windows technique to save hard drive space. In the background, Windows compresses files as they are written to the disk, and uncompresses them as they are read back. This shouldn’t stop you from opening any files, and it shouldn’t have relocated any of your folders. Nevertheless, if you encounter compressed files or folders that you don’t want compressed, you can turn it off by doing the following: Right-click on the file or folder and select “Properties.” In the “General” tab, select “Advanced ...” Under “Compress or Encrypt attributes,” uncheck “Compress contents to save disk space.” Press OK, then press OK again.
I think what you’re seeing is the second kind of arrow. This one is a blue arrow in a white box in the lower-left corner of the file’s icon. This means what you are looking at is not the file, but merely a shortcut to it, and the file or folder is actually located somewhere else. You can find out what the shortcut is pointing to by right-clicking it and selecting “Properties.” On the “Shortcut” tab, you’ll see a line that reads “Target:” If this is, indeed, what happened on your computer, again I’ll say this should not be stopping you from accessing your files. I wonder if that box you’re seeing is just a friendly notice that your files were relocated for you, and if you read a little more carefully and try again, you’ll find they’re accessible in a new location.
To bring this discussion around full circle, one thing that I’ve seen that relocates files and leaves shortcuts behind in their place is Microsoft OneDrive. It’s possible that you accidentally turned it on, or that a Windows update did it for you, and OneDrive went to work, creating a new folder and moving your files there so it could start to back them up into the cloud. I got you a link to a Microsoft Support article where you can learn how to turn off, temporarily disable or even remove OneDrive altogether. Check it out at tinyurl.com/IGTM-0853.

“Ohio is committed to ensuring the success of the Silicon Heartland,"" Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement. ""Bringing together industry partners to onshore this critical industry is key to strengthening our national security, spurring future innovation, and making our economy more resilient.”
The CHIPS and Science Act, formally called Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors in America, provides $52.7 billion in subsidies to companies as part of the push to restore production of the tiny devices to the U.S. that has largely moved overseas over the past decades.
Intel has indicated it has applied for aid under the act for its project in New Albany and its three other big campuses in the U.S.
The Commerce Department, which is overseeing the CHIPS Act, wants to create two clusters of factories making semiconductors as part of the distribution of the money.
An agency document describes a cluster as a geographically compact area with multiple, commercial scale fabs owned and operated by one or more companies.
The creation of the consortium is a next step in a state that's been working to build out a semiconductor ecosystem since Intel announced nearly two years its plans to spend $20 billion to build two factories, calls in in Licking County.
The state's educational institutions, government partners, JobsOhio and the private sector have been working together with Intel to prepare for the company's arrival here.
The state says the creation of the consortium formalizes those partnerships.
Ohio leaders say the state is a logical choice for one of the two clusters, and the creation of the consortium will contribute to Ohio's position as a leading contender for these federal funds.
Intel has agreed to serve as the anchor institution in the consortium to support existing suppliers and attract other key suppliers to Ohio.
“We look forward to supporting the efforts of semiconductor suppliers looking to expand operations and join us in the Silicon Heartland,"" Jim Evers, an Intel vice president and leader of the New Albany project, said in a statement. ""This consortium will accelerate the formation of the Ohio semiconductor cluster and will help ensure the long-term growth and success of the semiconductor industry in the Buckeye State.”

But Musk was left dumbfounded after Hassabis said that AI might destroy his colonies on Mars.
Musk invested in DeepMind after that conversation with Hassabis, per The Times.
DeepMind cofounder Demis Hassabis scored an investment from Elon Musk after he pointed out the shortcomings in Musk's plans to colonize Mars.
Musk told Hassabis that he'd hoped humanity could avoid the threats from living on Earth by colonizing Mars, per a story by The New York Times published on Sunday.
According to The Times, Musk was chatting with Hassabis after giving the latter a tour of the SpaceX headquarters in 2012.
Hassabis told Musk that the plan would work if artificial intelligence didn't make the trip to Mars. According to Hassabis, AI being in the mix would lead to the human colony's destruction, too.
Musk invested in Hassabis' AI company soon after — along with Peter Thiel — so he could find out more about the tech, per The Times. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for $500 million.
Musk has since become a vocal critic of the dangers posed by AI. In March, Musk told a Tesla shareholder during the company's investor day that he was ""a little worried about AI stuff.""
""I think it's something we should be concerned about. We should need some kind of regulatory authority or something, overseeing AI development and making sure it's operating within the public interest,"" Musk said then.
Musk also has his own AI startup, xAI, which he announced in July. In November, Musk unveiled xAI's new chatbot, Grok, framed as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT.
According to the xAI website, the company aims to advance humanity's ""collective understanding of the universe.""

The Austin-based EV maker is estimated to have handed over almost 483,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That means Tesla probably exceeded its goal to deliver 1.8 million cars last year, an all-time high for the company but just a fraction of what Toyota Motor Corp. or General Motors Co. normally sell.
For its next phase of growth, Tesla has to win over everyday buyers, who primarily select vehicles based on price and ease of use. “When you look at car buying in general, we’re trying get to the next set of EV adopters,” Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said during an investor call in October.
The Musk-led company faces a number of hurdles to reach that crowd: Inflation and high interest rates have made consumers more cautious about big purchases. Additionally, plenty of buyers still wonder about safety, and if there are enough charging stations. Those who do decide to make the switch from gasoline-powered cars also have an ever-expanding pool of EVs to pick from, besides Tesla.
In another challenge, on Jan. 1, some of Tesla’s models are expected to lose the full, $7,500 federal EV tax credit thanks to stricter battery-component sourcing rules from China. The company’s website says some versions of the Model 3 will be affected.
Tesla took some steps to break into the mass market in 2023. It slashed prices across its lineup, sacrificing profit margins for volumes. The markdowns were especially pronounced in China, the market where Musk has said it’s most difficult to compete.
However, the EV maker will likely still be surpassed by China’s BYD Co., which has a much fresher lineup. Tesla’s newest vehicle, the futuristic-looking Cybertruck still hasn’t reached volume production and is at least a year away from profitability, Musk said in October. The carmaker probably handed over between 200 and 5,000 Cybertrucks in the quarter, analysts estimated.

Tesla has yet to give guidance for how many vehicles it expects to deliver in 2024. The two models that have accounted for about 97% of the company’s deliveries this year — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle — first launched in 2017 and 2020.
“We struggle to understand how underlying demand is likely to materially improve with an increasingly aged product lineup, and no incremental reduction in price, amid increasing competition in the EV space,” Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst who has the equivalent of a sell rating on Tesla shares, wrote in a research note to clients this week. “Equally importantly, we don’t see the situation improving in 2025.”
Tesla does have a few levers to pull to boost sales going forward. It revamped its Model 3 sedan this year, giving it a sleeker look and longer range. It first offered the vehicle in China before selling it in Europe, and the new Model 3 is expected to reach the US in 2024, though Tesla hasn’t confirmed timing. Additionally, the company is said to be planning to roll out a new version of the Model Y from its Shanghai plant.
Tesla is also expanding its marketing efforts. Tesla has built a formidable brand without paying for traditional advertising, but it’s recently begun experimenting with Google ads. One that’s out now touts the ability to lease a Model Y for $399 a month.
Owuraka Koney, a managing director at Jennison Associates, which holds a stake in Tesla, said he believes the EV maker is doing a lot to reach the next wave of potential customers.

The Cybertruck is drawing curious buyers to Tesla showrooms. Additionally, he said Tesla executives besides Musk, such as design chief Franz von Holzhausen and Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering, are speaking out more on behalf of the company to market Tesla’s products.
“If you look at global EV sales, BYD and Tesla are still the main players driving the volume,” Koney said. “Going forward, Tesla will continue to be well-positioned.”

The CEOs of OpenAI and Tesla, respectively, have dined together and shared a stage. They worked together to launch OpenAI in 2015 to counter Google’s dominance in artificial intelligence.
But these days the tech luminaries are not on great terms. They've often swiped at each another on social media and in other public venues. So what happened?
Obviously the direction OpenAI has taken plays a role (see below), but Altman described another element to help explain the falling out in a Sunday New York Times article.
“There is disagreement, mistrust, egos,” he told the paper. “The closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are. You see this in sects and religious orders. There are bitter fights between the closest people.”
Altman and Musk certainly seemed pointed in the same direction during a dinner in 2015 at the Rosewood Sand Hill, a luxurious ranch-style hotel in Silicon Valley. Google had just acquired DeepMind, a neural networking startup based in London, which made it the most likely company to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a system that can match humans when faced with an unfamiliar task.
At the dinner, the two men, along with others gathered, discussed starting an AI lab that would be transparent, open-source, and dedicated to democratizing the benefits of advance artificial intelligence. Musk and a few other members of the “PayPal mafia”—including Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman—invested millions to get the lab rolling.
'Not what I intended at all'
OpenAI launched in 2015, but after a power struggle, Musk parted ways with it in 2018. The nonprofit, needing financial and computing resources, turned to Microsoft, which, starting in 2019, committed to investing billions into it. Altman formed for-profit company under the nonprofit, an unusual structure that contributed to him being briefly fired then rehired as CEO last month.
Since parting ways with OpenAI, Musk has expressed disgust with its direction under Altman, especially after OpenAI accepted billions in investments from Microsoft.
“OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it ‘Open’ AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,” he tweeted earlier this year. “Not what I intended at all.”
Musk has long warned of the potential danger advanced AI poses to humanity, but he also sees its promise if developed safely. Via his startup xAI, last month he announced Grok, an AI chatbot to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the release of which late last year kicked off the current AI boom.
Altman quickly roasted Grok, suggesting on X that it “answers questions with cringey boomer humor in a sort of awkward shock-to-get-laughs sort of way.”
Musk shot back that OpenAI’s GPT-4—which he dubbed “GPT-Snore”—lacks a sense of humor, calling it “about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.”
Altman called Musk a “jerk” during the On With Kara Swisher podcast, though he acknowledged the role he played in attracting top AI talent to OpenAI. Musk was pivotal to recruiting from Google OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who joined other board members in firing Altman last month, only to backtrack soon after.
Part of feud may stem from Musk’s personality. He’s also traded barbs with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for years as the two have competed in their space ambitions. And he broke off his friendship with Google cofounder Larry Page, a falling out that he said stemmed largely from Musk poaching Sutskever.
“He has a style that is not a style that I’d want to have for myself,” Altman said of Musk on the Swisher podcast.
But Altman also said that Musk “really does care about a good future with AGI,” which gets back, perhaps, to his more recent comments that “the closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are.”

The company has long been transforming itself for the age of cloud computing. Progress has been slow.
IBM now appears to be hitting its stride. The company has shed around 15 businesses in recent years, including the spinoff of its managed infrastructure services unit into Kyndryl. While the company has made plenty of acquisitions as well, notably the $34 billion purchase of Red Hat in 2019, these actions have shifted IBM's focus to its best growth opportunities and away from slow-growing legacy businesses.
Hybrid cloud and AI
The two biggest growth opportunities for IBM are hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company is going after both through its software and consulting businesses.
Red Hat forms the foundation of IBM's hybrid cloud efforts. OpenShift, Red Hat's containerization platform, controlled nearly 50% of the container software market in 2020. Red Hat's software can run anywhere, including on competing public cloud platforms and on on-premises servers.
IBM's AI efforts are now being driven by Watsonx, a new AI platform that enables enterprises to deploy AI models while handling regulatory and data privacy concerns. Like its hybrid cloud platform, Watsonx isn't tied to IBM's own cloud. A portion of the AI platform is already available through Amazon Web Services.
Tying all this together is IBM's consulting business, which provides guidance and crafts solutions for clients. IBM wins by delivering the best solutions possible for its clients, and that often involves products from other technology companies. A slew of strategic partnerships struck in the past couple of years, including one with AWS that brought IBM's software to the leading cloud platform, allows the consulting arm to mix IBM products more easily with products from partners.
A reasonable valuation and a nice dividend
By embracing the platforms and products that its clients want to use, IBM has rekindled its growth. Revenue is expected to grow by 3% to 5% this year excluding the impact of currency, a solid result compared to IBM's performance in recent years. A full 75% of IBM's revenue now comes from software and consulting, and about half of total revenue is recurring in nature.
IBM's bottom line is also improving thanks to the high-margin nature of its growing software business. While revenue expanded by just 3% in the third quarter, gross profit jumped 8%, pretax income rose 17%, and earnings per share soared 22%. Free cash flow also improved, and the company is on track to deliver free cash flow of $10.5 billion this year. That's up more than $1 billion from 2022.
IBM stock has rallied about 15% this year, pushing its market capitalization up to roughly $149 billion. Based on the company's guidance, the stock trades for about 14 times free cash flow. While IBM's revenue won't grow much faster than the mid-single-digit percentage the company is targeting as part of the mid-term model it rolled out in 2021, free cash flow can grow faster as margins improve. If IBM can keep growing free cash flow at a high single-digit rate annually, at least on average, the valuation looks reasonable.
That free cash flow fuels the company's dividend, which it has paid uninterrupted since 1916. The dividend has been increased annually for 28 years in a row. The current quarterly dividend of $1.66 per share works out to a dividend yield of about 4.1%. Dividend growth has been slow since the pandemic, but it could pick back up as free cash flow expands.
It's been a long road for IBM over the past decade as the century-old company rejiggered itself for a cloud-first, AI-heavy world. The hard part now appears to be over, as IBM's portfolio of products and services is aligned with these two growth opportunities. If IBM can maintain its revenue and free cash flow growth, it won't be long before it starts carving out new all-time highs for the first time in more than a decade.

The accusation was one of the final punches Page threw in the argument he and Musk had been having that night about the threat intelligent machines posed to humanity, The New York Times reported.
The two tech execs had been friends for more than a decade by the time of the party and started off the night exchanging jokes. But the conversation eventually turned to AI and got heated.
As several other party attendees listened, Page outlined his version of a ""digital utopia"" in which humans would eventually merge with intelligent machines, giving rise to a competition between various forms of intelligence, according to The Times account. Musk's take was that society would be doomed because machines would wipe out humanity.
Musk's biographer, Walter Isaacson, also wrote about the fight but dated it to 2013 in his recent biography of Musk. Isaacson wrote that Musk said to Page at the time, ""Well, yes, I am pro-human, I fucking like humanity, dude.""
Musk's birthday bash was not the only instance when the two clashed over AI.
Page was CEO of Google when it acquired the AI lab DeepMind for more than $500 million in 2014. In the lead-up to the deal, though, Musk had approached DeepMind's founder Demis Hassabis to convince him not to take the offer, according to Isaacson. ""The future of AI should not be controlled by Larry,"" Musk told Hassabis, according to Isaacson's book.
Musk later helped to launch OpenAI as a nonprofit research lab dedicated to ensuring AI systems would benefit humanity. He eventually left OpenAI's board in 2018 after a failed attempt to take over and has since launched his own AI startup called xAI to ""understand the true nature of the universe.""
OpenAI's board has had its own disagreements about the dangers artificial intelligence poses to humanity. Those tensions were one of the reasons OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company.",finance.yahoo.com,Larry Page accused Elon Musk of favoring human species over digital life

A new pair of designer shoes. An extra coffee run. All of that spending can add up — and according to John Lopez, a senior professor of practice at the University of Houston’s C.T. Bauer College of Business and CFP, understanding your emotional reaction to money and to marketing — and its relationship with lifestyle — is an essential personal finance lesson.

The financial advice that’s available “is pretty good,” Lopez told GOBankingRates. He noted that as far as people deciding whether or not to follow personal finance advice they read about, they should “consider the source of the article” and get advice from people who don’t have a conflict of interest.
Emotional Spending and Lifestyle Beliefs Can Be Dangerous
What’s destructive, Lopez said, is emotional spending. He explained that people are continuously subject to beliefs like “If I don’t have an Apple computer, I’m a loser. If I’m not shopping at Starbucks, I’m a loser. If I’m not driving this particular car, I’m a loser.” And those beliefs can have serious consequences.
“So they go into debt, they don’t have savings, they’re living paycheck to paycheck, they have cars they can’t afford,” Lopez said.

Marketers try to get people to have an emotional connection to products, he added. As far as avoiding marketing? “I don’t think you can,” he said, “whether you’re scrolling through something online or watching a TV show or are walking around,” marketing is ceaseless and being aware of it is vital.
But by recognizing their emotional reactions when spending, people can make better decisions, Lopez suggested.
He advised that people understand their cash flows and ask themselves why they want to buy items. “Being aware of the reason that you’re spending,” he added, is important.
Lopez explained that when unexpected situations arise, without “some kind of emergency savings,” people can “begin the spiral of getting into debt.” He said that students should have $1,500 tucked away in an account strictly for emergencies and that working professionals should have three to six months of living expenses saved. He stressed that: “If people have emergency savings, that will change lives.”

But it turns out that it's been used by ""crazy people"" to help them find each other, he said.
Gates said he initially believed people would use the internet to responsibly seek information.
Bill Gates said he was originally expecting the internet to make the world a more fact-based, rational place, but has come to realize it's become a tool for disinformation and ""crazy ideas.""
""I will admit, the people who drove the digital revolution, including myself, really thought that the world would get more rational,"" Gates said at a fireside chat on Thursday in New York.
Gates was talking about the implications of artificial intelligence on the world, and reflected on his own predictions during the original digital revolution.
The Microsoft founder said that as the internet was taking off, he believed it would ""make the world so factual.""
He thought the internet would drive people to search up information and responsibly empower themselves, giving an example of how someone could learn about a lawsuit by looking up what both the plaintiff and defendant claimed without relying on a news article.
And if someone had a question about a topic in science, they could ""go read the articles and see everything about them,"" the billionaire said.
Internet entrepreneurs like him expected to drive ""Socratic debate,"" he added.
What Gates hadn't foreseen, however, was how the internet would be used by the world's people with ""crazy ideas,"" he said.
""There were a lot of them out there. They were just not finding each other,"" Gates said. ""And now, with digital tools, said: 'Oh you think that crazy thing? Me too! Let's get together and have a critical mass of crazy people. Let's, you know, call ourselves QAnon.'""
Gates said he hoped younger generations would be able creative enough to solve the disinformation issues of the current day.
The billionaire said he's open to AI being regulated — adding that anyone who fights against AI regulation just sounds ""stupid.""
Despite his admissions about the internet, Gates said he feels positive about AI, saying it could relieve labor shortages and make the world richer.

The effort includes updating the iPad Air, iPad Pro and MacBook Air, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the products haven’t been announced. The new iPad Air will come in two sizes for the first time, and the Pro model will get OLED screens — short for organic light-emitting diode. The MacBook Air, meanwhile, will feature the speedier M3 processor.
The Mac and iPad account for 15% of Apple’s revenue combined, and they’ve been particularly hard hit by a decline in consumer tech spending. The iPad slump has been compounded by a lack of new models. In fact, 2023 will be the first calendar year in the product’s history when no new versions were released.
There have been Mac releases in the past year, but that market faces a broader pullback for computers following a boom in pandemic spending. Mac sales tumbled 34% last quarter to $7.61 billion, while iPad revenue dropped 10% to $6.44 billion. They also make up a smaller portion of Apple’s total sales these days, with services — once a negligible contributor — now accounting for a much larger piece.
Apple is looking to the new models to help reinvigorate demand next year. The iPads and accessories are expected to launch around the end of March — alongside iPadOS 17.4 — according to the people familiar with the plans. The Macs are being developed alongside macOS 14.3. That software update is likely to be released between the end of January and February, but the hardware may not ship until the March time frame.
It’s not unusual for Apple to hold launch events for the Mac and iPad around March. A spokeswoman for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the company’s plans.

The iPad Air, which is the company’s mid-tier tablet, currently comes with a 10.9-inch screen. For next year’s release, the company will add a version that’s about 12.9 inches, matching the size of what’s currently the biggest iPad Pro. The company is readying four models — codenamed J507, J508, J537 and J538 — that will offer Wi-Fi-only and cellular versions of both sizes.
The additional screen size for the iPad Air is part of a strategy to offer more options at different prices. It lets consumers get a larger display without having to pay for the iPad Pro, which costs several hundred dollars more. This approach mirrors Apple’s strategy with the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.
The new Pro models are currently scheduled to be announced at the same time as the iPad Air. The OLED screens show a wider range of colors and will give the company’s tablets the same display technology used in the iPhone since 2017. The high-end tablet will get the M3 chip that was introduced with the MacBook Pro in October.
The company is planning four new iPad Pro models, codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721, with roughly 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes and both Wi-Fi-only and cellular configurations.
Apple’s new iPad Pro will mark the first overhaul to the product since the current design was introduced in 2018. The company had previously made smaller changes to the line, including bringing over chips from Macs and adding new cameras. These pricier tablets — which can top $2,000 with the highest storage capacity — are a key part of Apple’s bid to wring more revenue from the iPad.
The company is also preparing revamped versions of the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard accessories, which it will sell alongside the new iPad Pro. The new Pencil — codenamed B532 — will represent the third generation of the product. The company released a new low-end model in November.
The new Magic Keyboards — codenamed R418 and R428 — will make the iPad Pro look more like a laptop and include a sturdier frame with aluminum. The latest MacBook Airs — codenamed J613 and J615 — will continue to come in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. The main focus there will be the addition of the M3 chip.
Beyond those product lines, Apple also plans to release its Vision Pro headset early next year. For later in 2024, it’s working on an updated Apple Watch with blood pressure sensing and a refresh to the iPad mini. There will be a new low-end iPad and larger upscale iPhones, as well as revamped low-end and mid-tier AirPods that add a USB-C port.

AI content generators are known to sometimes invent things, which developers call hallucinations.
Gemini was tested on its problem-solving and knowledge in 57 subject areas including maths and humanities.
Boss Sundar Pichai said it represented a ""new era"" for AI.
Google adopted a cautious approach to the launch of its AI chatbot, Bard, earlier this year, describing it as ""an experiment"".
Bard made a mistake in its own publicity demo, providing the wrong answer to a question about space.
But Google is making some big claims for its new model, describing it as its ""most capable"" yet and has suggested it can outperform human experts in a range of intelligence tests.
Gemini can both recognise and generate text, images and audio - but is not a product in its own right.
Instead it is what it known as a foundational model, meaning it will be integrated into Google's existing tools, including search and Bard.
It will only be available in the US to start with.
Google has so far struggled to attract as much attention and as many users users as OpenAI's viral chatbot ChatGPT.
But it claims the most powerful version of Gemini outperforms OpenAI's platform GPT-4 - which drives ChatGPT - on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks.
However, a new, more powerful version of the OpenAI software is due to be released next year, with chief executive Sam Altman saying the firm's new products would make its current ones look like ""a quaint relative"".
It remains to be seen whether the recent turmoil at OpenAI - which saw Mr Altman fired and rehired in the space of a few days - will have any impact on that launch.
The firm also faces fresh competition from Elon Musk's xAI, which is seeking to raise up to $1bn to invest in research and development. Chinese firm Baidu is also racing ahead with its own AI products.
But as the technology rapidly evolves, so do fears about its potential to cause harm.
Governments around the world are trying to develop rules or even legislation to contain the possible future risks of AI.",finance.yahoo.com,Google claims new Gemini AI 'thinks more

It's one of the few AI segments already bringing in revenue thanks to its ability to instantly create text, images, videos, and computer code, which consumers and businesses are finding incredibly valuable.
Startups like OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT) and Anthropic have led the way on generative AI, but it's spreading through the technology sector like wildfire, with some of the world's largest companies investing billions of dollars in development. Two publicly traded companies emerging as superpowers in the generative AI industry are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and C3.ai (NYSE: AI).
Here's why investors should consider buying stakes in both of them right now.
1. Alphabet (Google) just unveiled Gemini, its most powerful AI so far
Alphabet has been working on AI for years. In fact, Google purchased DeepMind, a research and development company focused on building AI responsibly, way back in 2014. Nevertheless, investors still believed Alphabet was behind the curve when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) swooped in to acquire a $10 billion stake in OpenAI roughly a year ago.
Microsoft quickly integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. It was initially perceived as a threat to the dominance of Google Search, which has a 91% market share. Simply put, prompting an AI chatbot for answers is a more convenient way to find information than entering a query into a traditional search engine and sifting through web pages.
Alphabet launched a speedy response to that threat. It now has a chatbot of its own called Bard, but the company also embedded AI into the traditional Google Search experience. Now, when users enter a query, the search engine often provides a text-based response at the top of the page to save them from clicking through to different web results.
Alphabet also just launched Gemini, the company's most powerful generative AI model yet. According to the company, it's the first model ever to outperform human experts on an MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) basis. In other words, it's smarter than humans in many academic disciplines like elementary mathematics, U.S. history, and computer science (among others).
Most importantly, Alphabet management says Gemini outperforms OpenAI's most advanced GPT-4 model across most text-based and multimodal (image, video, and audio) tasks. In a series of demonstrations, Gemini displayed an ability to understand all of those media formats with powerful reasoning. For example, when shown a drawing of a guitar, Gemini identified it and played its sound. When the user added a drawing of an amplifier, Gemini understood how that changed the guitar's sound.
Alphabet is monetizing its AI technology through its cloud computing platform for businesses, Google Cloud. But Microsoft is already seeing success embedding AI into applications like Word and Excel in exchange for an additional monthly fee. Considering there are an estimated 1.8 billion Gmail users and over 1 billion Google Docs users worldwide, Alphabet has a substantial monetization opportunity ahead.
Alphabet is on track to deliver $5.74 in earnings per share in 2023 (ending Dec. 31), giving its stock a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of just 23.4. That's cheaper than both Microsoft stock and the Nasdaq-100 index, which trade at P/E ratios of 36.2 and 28.3, respectively, making Alphabet one of the best value plays in the AI space.
2. C3.ai is an AI pioneer, and its sales growth is ramping up
C3.ai was founded in 2009 and it was an early provider of enterprise AI solutions. Today, it offers businesses over 40 different turnkey AI applications to help them harness the power of the technology without having to build it from scratch, which takes considerable time and resources. C3.ai specializes in predictive AI; its models help banks fight fraud, and they help oil and gas companies monitor thousands of pieces of equipment to help prevent failures.
The company launched C3 Generative AI earlier this year to capture the growing opportunity created by applications like ChatGPT. It's a highly advanced tool specifically designed for enterprises; almost any organization within any industry can embed it into their operations to create a powerful virtual assistant tailored to the specific needs of their business.
C3 Generative AI can ingest both structured and unstructured data, the latter of which is found in Word documents, PDFs, invoices, contracts, and other mediums. The company says two-thirds of data within most organizations is never utilized primarily because it's unstructured, but users can upload almost any document type to this new platform. From there, they can use the intuitive search and chat interface to generate more valuable and actionable insights than ever before.
C3.ai sells its AI applications to businesses directly, but it also has an extensive partner network that includes cloud giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It just expanded its collaboration with AWS by creating C3 Generative AI: AWS Marketplace Edition, which will make C3.ai's generative AI directly available to millions of businesses on the world's largest cloud platform.
C3.ai is currently transitioning away from a subscription-based revenue model toward a consumption one instead, so that businesses only pay for what they use. This will dramatically reduce the time C3.ai spends negotiating with new customers, allowing them to sign up far more quickly.
This shift initially caused a slowdown in C3.ai's revenue growth (by design) while existing customers converted, but in the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), the company's sales jumped 17% year over year, which was the fastest pace in more than a year.
It could accelerate even further in the coming quarters, so investors have an opportunity to buy C3.ai stock right now ahead of a potential upswing in its business.

Gemini outperforms GPT-4 in math, coding, and subject knowledge at its most advanced tier, Google says.
Google also says it's the first model to match human-level experts in a test of 57 subject areas.
This week, Google unveiled Gemini, which already looks like a scarily smart rival to OpenAI's GPT-4.
Gemini consists of three different models that vary in size and capability. Its most advanced model, Gemini Ultra — which is not available to the public yet, but Google says is designed for ""highly complex tasks"" — outsmarts GPT-4 in several areas, from knowledge of subjects like history and law to generating code in Python to tasks that require multi-step reasoning, Google said in its announcement.
Google said that Gemini outperformed GPT-4 on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding test, or MMLU, which is one of the most popular methods to gauge the knowledge and problem-solving skills of AI models.
You could compare it to the ""SATs for AI models,"" Kevin Roose said on The New York Times tech podcast Hard Fork. The MMLU, however, is a bit more advanced than a typical college prep exam. It covers 57 subjects, including math, physics, history, law, medicine, and ethics, to test for both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities, according to Google's announcement.
Gemini Ultra scored 90% on the MMLU, while GPT-4 scored 86.4%, according to Google.
But Gemini Ultra's more impressive feat might be that it's also the first model to outperform human experts on the MMLU. Human experts scored about 89.8%, Google said in a technical report on Gemini.
""I think if you went back even two or three years and told AI researchers that Google will have a model that gets a 90 percent on the MMLU, that is better than the sort of benchmark threshold for human experts, they would have said, well, that's AGI,"" Roose said. AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that can process complex human capabilities like common sense and consciousness.
GPT-4 did beat out Gemini Ultra by several percentage points in an evaluation of common sense reasoning abilities for everyday tasks, according to Google.
But one advantage Google says that Gemini has over other models is that it's natively multimodal, which means it was designed from the ground up to process several types of data, from text to audio to code to images and video. Other multimodal models were created by ""stitching together"" text-only, vision-only, and audio-only models in a ""suboptimal way,"" Oriol Vinyals, the vice president of Research for Google's DeepMind, said in a video announcing Gemini.
As a result, Google says that Gemini's design allows it to understand inputs better than existing multimodal models. Researchers behind the SemiAnalysis blog also say Gemini will likely ""smash"" GPT-4 out of sheer computing power.
While Gemini Ultra has certainly set high expectations for its arrival, the jury is still out on how the trio of Gemini models will fare against OpenAI, which already has an advantage in consumer awareness.
Early reactions to the less advanced Gemini Pro, which is accessible through Google's chatbot Bard, have been positive. However, the model has also had issues with accuracy and hallucinations. It has even told people to resort to Google for answers to controversial questions.

"['Keith Speights, The Motley Fool']",2023-12-13 11:18:12+00:00,,2023-12-13 10:50:00,Both of these two AI stocks have been sizzling hot in 2023.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2F2-reasons-why-amd-better-105000453.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/3fc380d4efaee0cb1a078d8559e1a666,en,,"Which huge artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker has the most momentum right now? It's not Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Sure, Nvidia's shares have more than tripled in 2023. Over the last three months, though, the stock is only up by the low-single digits.
Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has more than doubled this year. And its stock has especially been on fire recently, jumping close to 30% over the last three months.
Investors have an interesting choice in picking between these two stocks. Here are two reasons why AMD is a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia -- and two reasons why it isn't.
Two reasons why AMD is better than Nvidia
1. Customers looking for an alternative
I'd argue that the top reason why AMD could be a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia right now is that customers are looking for an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This presents a tremendous opportunity for AMD to step up to the plate.
We've already seen this happen in recent days. Both Meta Platforms and Microsoft plan to use AMD's new Instinct MI300X AI chip. This appears to be a clear sign that tech giants are trying not to rely exclusively on Nvidia.
The bottom line is that if AMD offers a viable cost-effective alternative to Nvidia, the company could have greater growth prospects than Nvidia does. And that could enable its stock to continue outperforming Nvidia like it's done over the last three months.
2. Diversification if the AI chip market gets bumpy
With Nvidia, you pretty much get GPUs and nothing but GPUs. At least, that's been the story so far for the company. Reuters reported in October that Nvidia has started designing central processing units (CPUs) using Arm's technology. We have yet to see the fruit of these reported efforts, though.
For now, Nvidia is more dependent on the AI chip market than AMD is. That's not a bad thing when the AI market is booming as it has been this year. However, there's something to be said in favor of the diversification that AMD offers. The company makes more types of chips that are used for a broader range of purposes. Should the AI market experience some bumps in the road, AMD could weather the volatility better than Nvidia.
Two reasons why AMD isn't better than Nvidia
1. Nvidia's dominant market share
Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for training and powering AI applications. Unsurprisingly, the company dominates the AI chip market. Importantly, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. It is still investing heavily in research and development. It continues to roll out more powerful AI chips.
AMD probably won't dethrone Nvidia anytime soon. And unless it launches AI chips that are clearly superior to Nvidia's GPUs, any market share gains made by AMD likely won't hamper Nvidia's growth.
2. Nvidia is more attractively valued than AMD
Oftentimes, the up-and-coming rival is more of a bargain than the 800-pound gorilla in the industry. That isn't the case here. Nvidia is actually more attractively valued than AMD.
AMD stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 36. Nvidia's shares trade at a much lower 23.6 times forward earnings.
The picture looks even better when we factor projected growth into the equation. AMD's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.9 compared to Nvidia's seemingly dirt cheap 0.47.
The easy solution for investors
Both AMD and Nvidia should also deliver strong growth as the demand for AI soars. The good news is that investors don't have to pick which company will be the biggest winner. Investors have an easy solution: Buy both stocks.
I think that AMD and Nvidia could experience more choppiness over the next few years. It's unrealistic to expect either stock to continue doubling or tripling every 12 months. For long-term investors, though, both stocks provide an opportunity to profit from the AI boom over the next decade and beyond.

While myriad companies are participating in the AI marathon, the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are setting the pace. Among this cohort of stocks, perhaps the biggest beneficiary from the AI boom is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company recently reported earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, handily beating its revenue guidance and setting a new record.
But even after its 240% stock return so far this year, there are plenty of reasons to believe the party is just getting started for Nvidia. Let's dig into the tailwinds pushing demand for the company's semiconductor chips and assess if now is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
Artificial intelligence is fueling demand
Nvidia specializes in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs play a critical role in gaming, crypto mining, and AI. When it comes to AI use cases, GPU chips are designed to help power large language models (LLMs). This is important because LLMs are a core component of generative AI applications.
Given the skyrocketing rise of Microsoft's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard, it's easy to draw a dotted line connecting Nvidia to a host of other major AI players. To get a sense of just how much demand Nvidia is experiencing, let's take a look at the company's financial picture and how its valuation has shifted.
Nvidia's path to a $1 trillion valuation
The table below illustrates some of Nvidia's key financial metrics over the last year.
Data source: Nvidia Investor Relations.
You can see that Nvidia's revenue has increased by 206% over the last year. But perhaps even better is the company's bottom line. The impressive margin expansion has helped fuel a rise in profits, as diluted earnings per share increased from $0.27 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $3.71 for the most recent quarter -- over 12,000% growth in just one year.
Nvidia's eye-popping growth on both the revenue and earnings lines sheds light not only on the demand for its products, but the pricing power that the company can command given its market-leading position.
The chart above illustrates Nvidia's market cap over the last year. Since its fiscal third quarter 2022, Nvidia's market cap has grown over 200% to eclipse $1 trillion. Although this valuation might appear steep, a thorough analysis benchmarked against its peers might prove otherwise.
Should you buy Nvidia stock in 2024?
The chart below illustrates Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to its ""Magnificent Seven"" cohorts. Investors can see that Nvidia's forward P/E of roughly 40 is right in the middle of the pack. What is actually surprising to me is that Tesla, which is a known customer of Nvidia, is trading at a forward P/E nearly double that of Nvidia's.
Perhaps an even more head-scratching dynamic can be seen in the chart below.
Advanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's top rival. While AMD has been posting some impressive results of its own, the disparity between its forward P/E and Nvidia's is astounding. It may sound convoluted to say that a trillion-dollar company is cheap. But when you measure Nvidia against its megacap peers as well as its No. 1 rival, the case for buying the stock becomes increasingly clear.
As demand for AI applications continues to gain momentum, I see Nvidia continuing to play an integral role. And with the stock trading at discounts to smaller rivals as well as end customers reliant on the company's technology, now looks like a terrific opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares.

Policymakers from fully half of the Group of 10 jurisdictions of most-traded currencies are scheduled to meet in the coming days, and interest rates for 60% of the world economy will be set in a whirlwind 60-hour window.
Most notable will be the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday, followed on Thursday by central banks including those of the euro zone and the UK.
With the exception of Norway, which may conceivably raise borrowing costs, most monetary officials are confronting financial-market pressure to explain why they seem unhurried about pivoting to monetary easing.
Synchronized weakening in inflation data and some evidence of softening economies have prompted investors to ramp up bets on rate cuts in the first half of 2024. That’s a view that could clash with the mantra the Fed and its peers expounded little more than three months ago, of “higher for longer.”
In Latin America, which led the push upwards with rate hikes, most central banks are already on the way down, and Brazil and Peru may both cut in the coming week.
Their peers in the US and Europe aren’t so sure. After starting the year with renewed vigor to aggressively ramp up borrowing costs, they’re ending 2023 with more hesitation — setting the scene for what could become a prolonged standoff with investors.
“Central bankers are saying, ‘look, we’re waiting to see if what we’re seeing on this disinflation is sustainable,’” Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan, told Bloomberg Television. “We think you’re not looking to see cuts until the second half of the year.”
Federal Reserve
The Fed is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate at the highest level in two decades as policymakers assess the lagged impact of their aggressive series of hikes since early 2022.
As central bankers gather Tuesday to begin two days of deliberations, they’ll have fresh inflation data in hand. The core consumer price index is seen reinforcing expectations that Chair Jerome Powell, at his press conference the following day, will acknowledge both the progress made on inflation as well as the risks of stubborn price pressures.
The core CPI for November, which excludes food and fuel for a better snapshot of underlying inflation, is projected to climb 0.3% from a month earlier, when it rose 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, forecasters see a 4% advance that indicates that inflation is abating only gradually.
The inflation figures follow Friday’s solid labor-market report that showed healthy growth in employment and wages, along with a decline in the jobless rate.
Nonetheless, there are indications demand across the economy is cooling as the year draws to a close. November retail sales data on Thursday are expected to reveal consumers are becoming more guarded.
At the end of the week, industrial production figures are seen showing a partial rebound in factory output as striking auto workers returned to assembly lines.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“There’s no incentive for the Fed to sound too eager to cut rates, lest financial conditions loosen further. While the December FOMC meeting may not move all the way to endorse the bond market’s pricing of sharp rate cuts next year, we think it will meet them about halfway.”
—Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger and Estelle Ou, economists. For full note, click here
European Central Bank
President Christine Lagarde will probably try to temper market expectations that price in a quarter-point European Central Bank rate cut in April.
While the euro zone could well be in a recession, and policymakers acknowledge that the labor market is showing signs of turning, they aren’t fully convinced that the danger to consumer prices has passed, and want to see more wage data.
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel has called the inflation slowdown so far “remarkable,” and said that further rate hikes are now unlikely. But she hasn’t pivoted much further. One colleague, Peter Kazimir of Slovakia, termed expectations for a rate cut in the first quarter of 2024 “science fiction.”
Lagarde will present new forecasts, accompanied by a collective view on the risks to growth and inflation, that will likely be a central component of the ECB’s messaging to counter market speculation.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“Given the risks around the inflation outlook, the ECB is probably unhappy with interest-rate swaps pricing in a rate cut in March. Lagarde may make that clear in the press conference. Our view remains that the first cut will come in June and the risks are skewed toward earlier action.”

Bank of England
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold for a third straight meeting and deliver a warning that the fight against inflation is far from over.
With the UK economy facing stagnation at best next year, investors are betting that the Monetary Policy Committee will start cutting borrowing costs – now at a 15-year high of 5.25% — in June.
However, officials are likely to repeat their guidance that policy needs to remain restrictive for an “extended” period to stop inflation from sticking above their 2% target amid a still-tight labor market and price pressures in the services sector. The BOE announces its decision at noon on Thursday.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“We expect the BOE to double down on its message that policy is likely to remain restrictive for an extended period of time — services inflation is too high and there are tentative signs the economy may have regathered some momentum in the fourth quarter. There is still a long way to go on the road to 2% inflation.”

Switzerland
Swiss inflation is even weaker than in the neighboring euro zone — in fact, it has now declined to well below the 2% ceiling targeted by policymakers.
Speculation that they won’t cut rates as quickly as the ECB has pushed the franc to its highest level since the Swiss National Bank abandoned its cap on the currency nine years ago.
Even so, with Switzerland’s economy growing only feebly, officials will still face questions on the prospect of a reduction in borrowing costs in due course when they reveal their latest decision on Thursday.
Norway
Norges Bank faces a tough choice on whether or not to go ahead with a final quarter-point rate hike. Recent data could encourage officials to brush off potentially inflationary krone weakness and stay on hold as the economy cools.
Stagnation is anticipated for the current quarter before a contraction at the start of 2024, as businesses encounter more spare capacity and fewer hiring problems, a key sentiment survey by the central bank showed this week.
Meanwhile, building activity is falling sharply and retail activity is slowing, even as Norway’s fossil-fuel sector cushions some of the fallout from stubbornly high inflation and rising credit costs. The Norges Bank decision comes Thursday.
Russia
After raising its key rate by 200 basis points in October, the Bank of Russia will likely need to hike by another percentage point to 16% on Friday as policymakers strive to bring inflation back to their 4% target, according to Bloomberg Economics Russia economist Alexander Isakov.
Brazil
True to repeated signaling, Brazil’s central bank, led by Roberto Campos Neto, can be expected to deliver a fourth-straight half-point rate cut on Wednesday, to 11.75%.
A cooling economy and inflation that’s slowed back to within the central bank’s target range is widely expected to keep Banco Central do Brasil on that pace through the first quarter of 2024.
At that point, the board may slow the pace of rate reductions — depending on the global backdrop and state of local long-term inflation expectations, which remain above target across the entire forecast horizon.
Mexico
In Mexico, where Banxico typically doesn’t go in for dovish surprises, expect a unanimous decision on Thursday to keep the key rate at a record 11.25% for a sixth straight meeting.
Looking ahead, slowing core inflation and a cooling services component now have Governor Victoria Rodriguez saying that the rate-cut discussion could begin in early 2024. The consensus among analysts is for an easing cycle to begin in the first quarter.
Peru
Also on Thursday, Banco Central de Reserva del Perú’s December meeting finds the economy in recession and riding consecutive months of deflation, possibly making a case for a 50 basis-point reduction after three straight quarter-point cuts.
Still, upside risks to inflation from El Niño-related disruptions and ongoing political turmoil will likely see veteran bank chief Julio Velarde stay the course and lower the key rate to 6.75% from 7%.

Find out how to score cheap business class tickets for your next trip.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-finding-cheap-business-class-220014233.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/beb5d72e252328958d57acb1e49e7248,en,,"If you've ever gone to your favorite airline's website and compared pricing for an economy class ticket versus a business class ticket, you may have almost fallen out of your chair. That's because the standard business class ticket can be shockingly expensive. For the average flier, spending several thousand dollars on one ticket is out of the question. But that doesn't mean you can't find cheap business class flights. Scoring a deal may be easier than you expect. Here's how.
Pay attention to flight deals announced in email newsletters
Many airlines promote sales via email to subscribers, and it's not uncommon for business class deals to be advertised. If you're a member of airline loyalty programs, you likely already get access to such emails, so don't rush to throw them in the trash. It pays to open these emails.
Discounted flight offers may be limited to select destinations or available only during specific travel dates. If you have a less-flexible schedule or set destination in mind, these deals may not be ideal for you. But you can benefit if you're an adventurous traveler with flexibility.
Use online search tools to save big
Another way to score cheap business class seats is by using online flight search and pricing tools. Google Flights is one popular option that makes searching for business class airfare a breeze. You can use the provided search filters to narrow your options for premium seats.
Another can't-miss feature is the ability to track airfare prices. Google will email you when prices change for your preferred travel dates, so you don't miss out if prices drop significantly. Being able to time when to buy your tickets to get the best deal can benefit your personal finances.
Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards
One final tip: Flexible travelers can get a better deal. You can play around with dates to find the lowest prices as you search for airfare. If you have a flexible schedule, you may save more. You can search ""Anywhere"" instead of a set destination to find the cheapest destinations with affordable business class flight options. Let the deals decide where you go!
Invest in a flight deals membership
You don't have to do all the work yourself. If you're short on extra time but want to land cheap business class flights, you can pay someone else to do the work. Flight deal subscriptions like Going, Dollar Flight Club, and Thrifty Traveler can help you find the best premium class flight deals. You can plan your travels around deals like this to keep more money in the bank.
You must pay an annual fee for these services, but they can offer savings of hundreds or thousands a year for frequent travelers. Membership pricing for the flight deal subscriptions highlighted above range from $90 to $199 per year to access business class deals. I've used services like this to book affordable business class tickets, so I know they're the real deal.
Redeem your credit card rewards for airfare
Thanks to credit card rewards, a business class flight may be more within reach than you think. If you have travel rewards earned from travel credit cards, use them up. You may be able to transfer your rewards to an airline partner and redeem them to help cover the cost of a business class ticket.
Why pay thousands of dollars to fly in style if you can use your credit card rewards to save money? If you're new to earning travel rewards, check out the best travel rewards credit cards to learn how to earn rewards on your spending and access valuable card perks.

Leveraged funds’ net yen shorts increased by 2,833 to 65,611 contracts as of Nov. 28, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Japan’s currency appreciated almost 4% from a recent low of 151.91 per dollar set on Nov. 13 to 146.23 on Monday, the strongest since mid-September.
“We continue to see a limit to dollar-yen downside as long as the US appears to be achieving a soft landing and the BOJ remains reluctant to signal an imminent hiking cycle,” wrote Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Kamakshya Trivedi on Friday. “For that reason, we still think yen strength is approaching limits and should be faded.”
The bets from hedge funds add to signs that investors see yen weakness becoming more entrenched, even though overnight-indexed swaps are pricing in an end to the BOJ’s negative-rate policy by June. Japanese life insurers have recently cut currency hedging by the most in more than a decade, signaling receding concern of a rebound in the yen that would wipe out returns from overseas assets.
The BOJ will continue with monetary easing patiently to support the economy at home, Governor Kazuo Ueda said last month.

The ""dividend kings"" are publicly traded companies that have increased their dividend payouts to shareholders for at least 50 consecutive years. This is an extraordinary feat, especially when one considers the myriad of events that can transpire over half a century, such as economic booms and busts, technological revolutions, and major shifts in global market trends.

Despite these challenges, ""dividend kings"" have thrived, delivering bigger dividend checks to shareholders every single year. This impressive record is a clear indicator of a strong and stable business, often marked with a durable competitive advantage in its industry.
Warren Buffett, an investing legend who values these competitive advantages and calls them ""economic moats,"" famously said that his favorite holding period is forever — a philosophy that aligns well with investing in companies that consistently increase their dividends. However, this doesn’t mean he’s not going to sell any of the stocks in his portfolio.
In fact, Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) sold $7 billion worth of equities while buying only $1.7 billion in Q3 2023 — meaning it was a net seller of about $5.3 billion worth of stocks.
Among the stocks Buffett sold during the quarter were two renowned ""dividend kings."" While it may be tempting to follow the Oracle of Omaha, keep in mind that each investor’s financial circumstances are unique — and Wall Street still sees upside in this duo.
Here’s a closer look at the two companies in question.
Johnson & Johnson
With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.
Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales, according to its 2022 Investor Fact Sheet.
Not only does Johnson & Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, the company's adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.
The stock has trended up for decades, all while returning an increasing amount of cash to shareholders. JNJ announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now yields 3.1%.
According to Berkshire’s latest 13F filing to the SEC, it offloaded its entire investment in JNJ in Q3 of 2023.
JNJ shares have fallen over 11% year to date, but Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford sees a rebound on the horizon. The analyst has an “outperform” rating on JNJ and a price target of $172, implying a potential upside of about 9%.

Procter & Gamble
Berkshire also sold off its entire stake in Procter & Gamble (PG) in Q3 — a company with an even longer dividend growth track record than JNJ.
P&G announced a 3% dividend increase in April 2023, marking its 67th consecutive annual payout increase. The stock currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.5%.
It’s easy to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak.
P&G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergent. These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing.
While shares have risen by less than 1% in 2023, they are up 65% over the last five years, and JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira sees further upside on the horizon. The analyst has an “overweight” rating on P&G and a price target of $169 — around 11% above where the stock sits today.
Still a dividend junkie
Despite selling off these two dividend giants, Buffett still reaps substantial income from his portfolio’s other holdings. In fact, all of Berkshire’s top five publicly traded holdings as of Sept. 30 had a dividend policy.
Notably, his fourth-largest holding was Coca-Cola (KO) at the end of Q3. Coca-Cola is another Dividend King — the company has increased its payout to shareholders for 61 years straight.
Buffett has claimed he drinks five cans of Coke daily. Berkshire has held Coca-Cola in its portfolio since the late ’80s and it continues to collect dividends from the investment.
And the amount might surprise you.
Coca-Cola is on track to pay four quarterly dividends totaling $1.84 per share in 2023. Considering that Berkshire owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, it’s on track to collect $736 million in dividends from the beverage giant this year.

Ron Wyden wants to know if foreign governments are compelling Apple and Google to let them monitor users' activity.
Wyden said his office got a tip last year that foreign officials were demanding data.
Apple said the US government barred it from revealing this practice.
Apple and Google won't reveal if foreign government officials have compelled them to share some users' push notification data to aid in investigations into people of interest, a US lawmaker said.
""I write to urge the Department of Justice (DOJ) to permit Apple and Google to inform their customers and the general public about demands for smartphone app notification records,"" Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland this week.
Wyden said his office got a tip last year that foreign government agencies were demanding push notification data from the two tech giants.
But when Wyden's office contacted the companies, they said the US government had ""restricted"" them from revealing ""information about this practice"" to the public, the letter said.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Apple told Reuters in a statement that Wyden's letter allowed it to publicly comment on the practice.
""In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,"" the company told Reuters. ""Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.""
After Apple put out the statement, it also updated its Law Enforcement Guidelines to say that a user's Apple ID can be ""obtained with a subpoena or greater legal process,"" The Washington Post reported.
Apps don't deliver push notifications directly to smartphone users; instead, Wyden's letter said, they go through a ""digital post office run by the phone's operating system provider.""
When users enable push notifications, Google and Apple create tokens that tie their devices to identifying information they've provided to the companies.
""These services ensure timely and efficient delivery of notifications, but this also means that Apple and Google serve as intermediaries in the transmission process,"" Wyden's letter said.
His letter said that the DOJ should permit the two companies to share information about legal demands they receive, especially from foreign governments, and to inform specific users about demands for their data, unless prohibited by a court.",finance.yahoo.com,"Apple and Google won't say if foreign governments are keeping tabs on you through your push alerts, senator

“We were extremely concerned that they didn’t take those two extra steps — release of political prisoners and getting our wrongfully detained Americans home,” Kirby said on CBS’ Face the Nation. “That’s something we take very seriously, getting those folks home, and we’re going to keep at it.”
President Joe Biden’s administration announced a deal with Venezuela in October to lift some sanctions, including a six-month authorization of oil and gas transactions in the country.
The license will only be renewed if Maduro begins the release of detainees and meets commitments toward fair presidential elections, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time. The US will “reverse the steps we have taken” if Venezuela fails to deliver, Blinken said.
Venezuela said that it opened the door for opposition leaders to join presidential elections ahead of the deadline, meeting one part of the agreement, though there has been no release of captive Americans.
A US official said last month that “everything is on the table,” if Maduro fails to meet the requirements set by the US, including the removal of licenses allowing the export of Venezuelan oil and gas.

""Europe is experiencing an alarming increase in hate speech and hate crime and evidence shows that Jewish and Muslim communities are particularly affected,"" the commission said in a statement.
The commission said it would increase spending on the protection of places of worships by 30 million euros, including a rise of 5 million euros ($5.4 million) to address the threat of rising antisemitism.
In the first two weeks since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, Austria recorded a 300% increase in anti-Semitic incidents compared to 2022, while the Netherlands saw a rise of 800% on the previous monthly average, the Commission's vice-president Margaritis Schinas told a press conference.
The Commission said it would push for stronger rules to counter illegal hate speech online under a code of conduct signed with online platforms, to be finalised in the next three months, in addition to the stricter regulation for large online platforms that has been introduced earlier this year in the Digital Services Act (DSA).
The current code of conduct dates back to 2016, when Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft agreed to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours in Europe. More platforms like Instagram, TikTok or LinkedIn have joined it since.
Asked about specific actions under the DSA, the Commission's vice-president Vera Jourova said it was collecting data and evidence which might indicate that ""some of the very large online platforms are or might not be fully compliant with the requirements.""
""These platforms are now receiving letters with a concrete set of questions stemming from our findings and observation of what we see online,"" she added.
Any firm found in breach of the DSA faces a fine worth up to 6% of its global turnover, and repeat offenders may be banned from operating in Europe altogether.
The Commission said it would support training for journalists on upholding media standards and recognising hate speech, while increasing support to fact checkers within the EU and the Arab speaking world.

In addition to shifting to a modern aesthetic and neutral tones throughout, several treatment rooms were added.
Bathrooms were refitted with Ann Sacks tiles and Kohler Co. fixtures, and the cafe was renovated and brightened by removing shutters. There are also more seating and waiting areas with hospitality bars with fruit- and herb-infused water. The pedicure and manicure area was updated, with new ADA chairs.
Renovations took almost six months, finishing mid-October ahead of the Kohler Food & Wine event. Kohler Waters Spa Director Nikki Miller said the spa doesn’t have an official estimate on the renovation costs.
""A lot of ... the fixtures and amenities were sourced within, so that's an advantage that we have over others,” Miller said.

Kohler Waters Spa opened 23 years ago with 12 treatment rooms and a mission to incorporate water into a practice of healing, according to Miller. Its predecessor was a spa in the basement of the Kohler Sports Core.
“Our identity was healing people and changing people's lives through the movement of water, and it was fitting because being part of the leading global plumbing business, we (Kohler Co.) do water,” Miller said.

Details across the spa were fashioned to fit this purpose, from the original carpet pattern resembling waves to the sounds of a waterfall in the pool.
Water is also incorporated into the spa’s treatments, through spa features like hot tubs, a pool, stillness tub and the Kohler Vichy shower.
There are also hot/cold water circuits and water bladders to heat treatment tables.
“It was all about, ‘How do we immerse the guest, and in deepening and enhancing their relaxation through water ... how do we continue that education for them?’” Miller said.
The spa will undergo a second phase of renovations in the future to upgrade some of the treatment rooms and tiling. Calcified cement and discolored tile around the waterfall could be changed, too.
Today, Kohler Waters Spa offers a variety of treatments, like hydrotherapy, massages and salon services. In tandem with the Global Wellness Institute, a global nonprofit aimed at promoting health and wellness, and International Spa Association partnerships and guest feedback, Miller said the spa team researches and experiences different sensations to develop treatments.
Miller said the spa will eventually form into a boutique wellness destination, shifting away from being a functional tool to being an amenity and finding ways to be more innovative in promoting proactive health. One thing she mentioned was using more artificial intelligence to help identify physical conditions and ailments.
“It's not the 'be all say all,' but it's certainly a tool that's going to help us identify how we can help somebody make some changes in their life that will make them feel better,” Miller said.

['Martha McHardy'],2023-12-06 19:19:36+00:00,,2023-12-06 18:52:11,Senator Ron Wyden warned unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via their apps’ push notifications,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fgovernments-accused-using-apple-google-185211917.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/671498106d0997ba1d267a1229b0a05b,en,,"Governments have been accused of using Apple and Google push notifications to spy on users.
In a letter to the Department of Justice, senator Ron Wyden warned unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via their apps’ push notifications.
Smartphone users across the world receive push notifications every day which alert them to incoming messages, breaking news and other updates.
All such notifications travel over Google and Apple’s servers, meaning the two companies get a unique insight into the traffic flowing from those apps to their users.
Senator Wyden said this puts Apple and Google “in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps.”
He added that foreign officials are demanding such data from the two tech companies, citing a “tip” as the source of the information.
While the senator did not elaborate on the tip, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that both US government agencies and foreign governments allied to the US had asked Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications.
The Reuters source added that the government agencies had asked for such data to tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.
In his letter, Mr Wyden asked the Department of Justice to “repeal or modify any policies” that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.
A Google spokesperson told The Independent the company “share(s) the Senator’s commitment to keeping users informed” about requests by governments for user data.
“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden. We share the Senator’s commitment to keeping users informed about these requests,” the spokesperson said.
The Independent has contacted Apple for comment.
While most smartphone users are unaware of the data protection issues associated with push notifications, tech experts have warned that they are a “privacy nightmare” and that they are difficult to deploy without sending data to Google or Apple.
Concerns over the protection of smartphone data by tech giants such as Apple and Google have been prevalent in the past few years.
In 2018, the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to the heads of Apple and Google to demand they make clear whether iPhones and Android devices are collecting information about their users, and how that data is used.
The committee warned that the companies may be tracking their users, including tracking their location and listening in to what they are doing through their microphones.
Meanwhile, in 2021, Google followed Apple by rolling out “nutrition labels” that inform users of whether an app collects data on a user’s location, contacts, personal information, photo and videos, audio files, or storage files.
In recent months, US lawmakers have raised fears over the weaponization of personal data by foreign governments, particularly China.
In January 2020, the United States Army and Navy banned TikTok, which is owned by China-based tech giant ByteDance, on government devices after the Defense Department labeled it a security risk.
US lawmakers have expressed concern over the ability of the Chinese Communist Party to access the data of US citizens using the app, and have considered implementing a nationwide ban on TikTok.",finance.yahoo.com,Governments accused of using Apple and Google push notifications to spy on

Its shares closed 2% higher, extending its gains for 2023 to 49%.
The tech giant is on track to end the year as the world’s most-valuable company for the fifth time in a row.
Apple passed the $3 trillion threshold once again Tuesday, with the Cupertino, CA-based tech giant on course to finish the year as the world's most-valuable company for the fifth time in a row.
Shares had climbed 2% by the end of the trading session, which boosted Apple's total market capitalization to $3.01 trillion, according to data from Refinitiv.
It's the first time since August that the company has been worth more than $3 trillion, after a so-so couple of months where concerns about its reliance on sales in China weighed on shares. Apple's earnings report for the July-September quarter showed its revenue from the Asian nation dropped 2.5%, amid signs that the world's second-largest economy is faltering with growth stagnating and property prices tumbling.
After Tuesday, Apple is up 49% in 2023. That's added nearly $1 trillion to its total market cap, by Business Insider's calculations.
It's comfortably outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index – but lagging five of the other ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks, with Nvidia, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft all racking up larger gains year-to-date.
Still, as long as Apple can hold off Microsoft — worth $2.74 trillion as of Tuesday's close — 2023 will see it extend a run of dominance that started in 2012.

"['Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool']",2023-12-13 11:51:32+00:00,,2023-12-13 11:15:00,Apple makes up nearly half of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fwarren-buffett-favorite-soared-nearly-111500694.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/245ca9cf8b017260cce42d768160e9ad,en,,"Warren Buffett is known for picking the right stocks, and his choices have produced billions of dollars in returns and double-digit percentage gains over time. As chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has delivered compound annual growth of more than 19% over 57 years. That's compared to 9.9% for the S&P 500. So, it's clear investors are right to pay close attention to the stocks he buys.
But Berkshire Hathaway actually doesn't own tons of stocks. There are only 45 names in the portfolio now -- and most of its value comes from just a few favorites. One of them is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for almost half of the portfolio.
And right now, Buffett has reason to be happy about this investment since Apple has climbed by almost 50% this year. But for investors who haven't yet bought Apple and would like to follow in Buffett's footsteps, is it too late? After such a gain, should you still buy this top stock?
Apple as a long-term investment
A look into the past shows us that Apple has proven its ability to be a great long-term investment. The company has increased earnings over time and has grown key financial metrics. High levels of free cash flow show us the company can afford to keep paying its dividends -- making Apple a player you can count on for passive income as well as share price growth.
And its gains in return on invested capital show the company has been benefiting from its investments, indicating that Apple has deployed its cash wisely.
All of this is thanks to a stellar collection of products -- from the iPhone to the Apple Watch -- that have helped the company build a rock-solid brand -- one that consumers prefer and won't abandon for a rival. This brand strength is Apple's moat, and it's the reason it has been able to grow product revenue over the years and why growth is continuing today.
In its fiscal Q4 2023 (which ended Sept. 30), Apple's total installed base of devices reached an all-time high across products and geographic areas. And iPhone sales set a fiscal Q4 record. The company also set fiscal Q4 records in several countries across the globe.
Apple demonstrated in the quarter that its gains in revenue aren't just due to its established customers, but also to growth in new customers. About half of Mac and iPad buyers in the quarter were new to those products.
Apple's services business
So, the mix of brand strength, returning customers, and new customers should keep Apple's earnings climbing -- but something else may actually be its biggest growth driver. I'm talking about Apple's services business, which depends on those who use Apple devices and subscribe for access to digital content, cloud storage, and more.
Apple this year reached a level of more than 1 billion paid subscriptions. And this could be the element that will kick off a whole new era of growth at Apple, an era you probably won't want to miss. Services revenue reached a record high in the most recent quarter, and gains aren't likely to stop there. Apple has a huge subscriber base right now, and as it launches new services or boosts old ones, it can grow its revenue just with today's subscriber base -- but it's likely its subscriber base will expand too.
Finally, what's great about subscription revenue is it's recurrent. You may not buy a new iPhone often, but once you own one, you'll likely sign up for services that ensure Apple a regular stream of revenue.
Is Apple cheap?
All of this sounds great, but is Apple, after this year's gain, still worth the investment? Here, it's time to look at valuation. Apple trades for about 29 times forward earnings estimates, a lower ratio than many other growth stocks, and the shares look reasonable considering the company's track record and prospects.
Yes, Apple shares have advanced quite a bit this year, and they probably won't continue upward at this pace without interruption. But they have what it takes to climb higher over time as consumers flock to Apple products, and their subscriptions progressively drive even more growth for the company year after year.
So, it isn't too late for you to follow billionaire investor Warren Buffett and pick up shares of this top-performing stock. Apple shares have plenty of room to run, and like Buffett, if you buy it and hold on, you may reap the rewards.

Social mobility refers to the ability of individuals to move up or down the socio-economic ladder within a society. Countries with high social mobility, like the Nordic nations (e.g., Denmark, Norway, Sweden), exhibit low-income inequality, strong education systems, and comprehensive social welfare programs. These countries prioritize equal opportunities, which promote upward mobility.
Conversely, social mobility in the US compared to other countries is low as the US often faces greater income inequality, limited access to quality education, and barriers to economic growth. It is worth mentioning that Pakistan, Cameroon, and Senegal are some countries with the lowest social mobility in the world.
Raj Chetty, an economist, recently talked about how hard it is for people in the United States to move up the economic ladder. His research shows that if someone was born in the 1980s or 1990s, they only have a 50/50 chance of doing better financially than their parents. His research also found that there could have been four times as many inventors in the US if everyone had the same opportunities, no matter their background. This means that because of inequality, the US might be missing out on a lot of great ideas and inventions.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) actively fosters social mobility in the UK through various initiatives. As the Gold Partner of the 2022 UK Social Mobility Awards, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) recognizes and celebrates efforts to improve social mobility.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s commitment extends to shaping Levelling Up Goals, a 14-point framework addressing social mobility challenges. The company's Levelling Up Impact Report details its community and infrastructure development contributions, focusing on education and upskilling initiatives.
Such initiatives also explain why Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been recognized as one of the top 75 employers in the UK for promoting social mobility in 2023. The Social Mobility Employer Index evaluates companies in eight areas, focusing on efforts like engaging with underserved communities and creating pathways for career growth. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s apprenticeship program, with an 85% success rate, and initiatives like The JOBS Project and Career Choice, confirms their dedication to creating a fairer society through opportunities for progression.
On the other hand, Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) has also been active in promoting social mobility through its multifaceted approach to education and community impact. One major aspect is its commitment to accessibility and inclusivity, as evidenced by its engagement in initiatives like the Global Day of Impact. With Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) volunteers contributing over 1,500 hours to mentoring students, the company actively provides an environment that goes beyond traditional learning, that focuses on personal development and community outreach.

Methodology
To list the countries with the highest social mobility in the world, we have taken two different metrics to assess social mobility by country in 2023. Firstly, we have looked at the World Economic Forum’s Global Social Mobility Index of 2020 and obtained the list of countries with the highest social mobility scores. Secondly, we used our list of the most egalitarian countries in the world. The idea is that the more egalitarian a country is, the less structural and systemic barriers there are to social mobility within the country.
We then took the rankings of each country from both these lists and averaged them and then ranked our final list based on those average rankings. The list of those average ranks is presented in descending order.
Please note that in the case of similar average ranks, a country with a higher social mobility index ranking was ranked higher.
Here is a list of the countries with the highest social mobility in the world.
15. New Zealand
Egalitarianism: 11
SM Index: 22
Average Rank: 16.5
In New Zealand, the recent achievement of the lowest-ever gender pay gap in the public service, at 7.1%, reflects the country’s ambitious commitment to fostering social mobility. The decline of 5.1 percentage points since the introduction of the 2018 Gender Pay Gap Action Plan confirms tangible progress. Additionally, New Zealand is a global leader in women's representation in top public service roles, with 53.5% holding such positions which is way above the OECD average.
14. Ireland
Egalitarianism: 10
SM Index: 18
Average Rank: 14
In Ireland, the importance of education in promoting social mobility has been further emphasized at a conference hosted by Matheson LLP and Trinity College Dublin. The annual Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) conference brought together leaders from different sectors, disclosing that two-thirds of organizations have integrated social mobility into their D&I strategies. Educational programs, like Transition Year initiatives, Third Level access programs, and scholarships, were highlighted as active measures promoting social mobility.
13. Canada
Egalitarianism: 12
SM Index: 14
Average Rank: 13
A survey by the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta reveals that 42% of Canadians identify themselves as middle class, while 17% each align with working, lower middle, and upper middle classes. Interestingly, only 1% see themselves as upper class. Despite 59% focusing on hard work as crucial for success, 35% believe their class remained static across generations. However, social class mobility is evident as 35% of citizens have achieved a higher status than their parents.
Canada is one of the most socially advanced countries in the world.
12. Luxembourg
Egalitarianism: 15
SM Index: 10
Average Rank: 12.5
Luxembourg made headlines by making all public transport free in 2020, aiming to reshape mobility habits and promote environmental sustainability. Deputy Prime Minister François Bausch mentioned how the decision will serve as a catalyst for societal change. Luxembourg is one of the countries with the highest social mobility in the world.
11. Australia
Egalitarianism: 8
SM Index: 16
Average Rank: 12
While Australia has a high social mobility, it is lagging behind when it comes to economic mobility. Treasury research reveals that children born into the poorest households face a limited chance of upward mobility, with only a 10% probability of becoming top-income earners in their lifetime. The study found that those in the bottom fifth of households have a 12.3% chance of reaching the top fifth, a figure 60% higher than in the United States.
10. Belgium
Egalitarianism: 16
SM Index: 8
Average Rank: 12
In an effort to improve social mobility in Belgium, the European Commission is allocating €2.8 million ($3.02 million) from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help 421 workers dismissed by Makro Cash & Carry. Following the retail chain's bankruptcy in January 2023, the support package included job search assistance, skills training, and guidance for potential entrepreneurs. Belgium is one of the countries with the highest upwork social mobility in the world.
9. Austria
Egalitarianism: 14
SM Index: 9
Average Rank: 11.5
In Austria, recent social policy developments aim to improve social mobility. The long-anticipated reform of long-term care addresses training, working conditions, and financial support for caring relatives. Despite falling short on structural challenges, this reform promises progress. Austria is also one of the most egalitarian countries in the world.
8. Germany
Egalitarianism: 9
SM Index: 11

In Germany, children born to wealthier parents are about 50% more likely to graduate high school (Abitur) than those born to less wealthy parents. This gap has stayed the same for recent generations despite more children getting the chance for higher education. Interestingly, social mobility varies a lot across different regions in Germany. Even within states, some areas show higher chances for upward mobility than others. This suggests that where you grow up in Germany can largely impact your opportunities.

Switzerland consistently makes progress in promoting social mobility, especially in education. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the country excels in providing equal opportunities for students from different backgrounds. Swiss students had more chances for upward educational mobility compared to the OECD average.
On a side note, Switzerland is one of the best countries to work and make money.

The recent agreement between Dutch banks and the central bank to simplify the process of opening business accounts for sex workers is a noteworthy step toward improving social mobility. By providing sex workers with easier access to financial services, this initiative contributes to reducing barriers that may hinder their economic mobility. Enhanced financial inclusion fosters social mobility by enabling individuals, including those in marginalized professions, to manage their finances more effectively and participate more fully in economic activities, thereby promoting upward social and economic mobility.

Among the chip manufacturers, none is more important than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.
It's already a monster with a $536 billion market cap. But could it grow enough to reach $1 trillion by 2030? Let's take a look.
Taiwan Semiconductor has some big-name clients
As the name implies, Taiwan Semiconductor (also commonly referred to as TSMC) is based in Taiwan. However, it's made several investments in the U.S., most notably its chip plant in Arizona. While this facility has had multiple problems starting up, it will eventually provide an additional source for these vital chips.
Among the reasons TSMC has been so successful is due to its best-in-class technology. Likewise, Samsung and Intel are among its chief competitors; however, they compete with many of Taiwan Semiconductor's largest clients, like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. These companies don't want to give their business to competitors, so they'd rather give it to a neutral third party like Taiwan Semiconductor.
When it comes to technology, Samsung and TSMC have left Intel in the dust. Taiwan Semiconductor is ramping up its production of 3 nm (nanometer) chips and is scheduled to start producing 2 nm products in 2025. Additionally, there are rumors of 1.4 nm chips being developed after that. Taiwan Semiconductor has a built-in revenue escalator every couple of years when it launches new products.
Upgraded chips and the demand for technology will push TSMC higher over the next decade. But will it be enough for the company to cross the $1 trillion valuation threshold?
The stock trades at a discount to the market
At its peak in early 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor held a market cap of nearly $730 billion. However, as chip demand subsided in 2022, the stock came tumbling down. This has weighed on TSMC's financials throughout 2023, although management believes the chip supply glut has nearly bottomed.
This sets the stage for a strong rebound in 2024 and beyond, as Wall Street analysts project 20% revenue growth in 2024. They also believe it will produce earnings per share of $6.12.
The downturn Taiwan Semiconductor's stock experienced in 2022 wasn't all due to a shrinking business. Some of it had to do with multiple contraction, which happens when investors aren't willing to pay as high a price for a stock than they normally would.
With Taiwan Semiconductor settling in around its long-term average, the stock looks fairly priced from a historical perspective. However, I'd argue that this price doesn't fully value the company. The S&P 500 trades at about 26 times earnings right now, which means the stock trades at a 29% discount to the market.
I have a hard time believing that Taiwan Semiconductor is a below-average business in the S&P 500, and if Taiwan Semiconductor can achieve analysts' projections for 2024 and trade at an earnings multiple of 22, it will have a market cap of nearly $700 billion.
If TSMC can grow its earnings at a 12% pace for five years (taking it to the start of 2030), it will be worth $1.23 trillion. Those don't seem like far-fetched estimates, and they make a pretty solid case for Taiwan Semiconductor to be worth at least $1 trillion by the start of 2030.
Furthermore, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 14.9%, which would demolish the long-term returns of the broader market.
As a result, I think Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent investment over the next five to 10 years.

In January 2022, Apple became the first company to reach a $3 trillion market capitalization, but then that market cap figure steadily decrease over the next year.
That decrease brought Apple back under $3 trillion, but it happened chiefly because of what were described as investor jitters.
This pattern repeated itself in June 2023, as Apple's valuation went back up over $3 trillion -- only to again fall steadily immediately afterwards.
June was when Apple announced its forthcoming Apple Vision Pro, and since then it has also launched the iPhone 15 range. But while investment analysts have been mixed in their advice about Apple, there have been issues over the iPhone 15 not selling as well as the iPhone 14, especially in China.
On December 5, Apple share price rose 2% to $193.42 per share. The trend continues on Wednesday morning, with the stock inching up in pre-market trading.
It's not clear how long it will retain that valuation, however. Apple routinely buys back stock, and Apple has already said that it does not expect annual revenue growth for its December quarter. This is the first full quarter where the iPhone 15 range was available, but could now be the fifth quarter in a row where Apple has seen declining sales.",finance.yahoo.com,Apple regains its $3 trillion valuation despite analysts doubts,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-regains-3-trillion-valuation-123611025.html,['AAPL'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 0, 'end': 5, 'score': 0.9979915618896481}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'US', 'normalized': 'US', 'company_key': None, 'start': 58, 'end': 60, 'score': 0.998703360557556}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'iPhone 15', 'normalized': 'iPhone 15', 'company_key': None, 'start': 179, 'end': 188, 'score': 0.995097219944}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 213, 'end': 218, 'score': 0.9986047148704521}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 382, 'end': 387, 'score': 0.9987857937812801}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 534, 'end': 539, 'score': 0.9988436698913571}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 651, 'end': 656, 'score': 0.998670101165771}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Apple Vision Pro', 'normalized': 'Apple Vision Pro', 'company_key': None, 'start': 683, 'end': 699, 'score': 0.998426139354705}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'iPhone 15', 'normalized': 'iPhone 15', 'company_key': None, 'start': 741, 'end': 750, 'score': 0.997674226760864}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 826, 'end': 831, 'score': 0.9974460601806641}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'iPhone 15', 'normalized': 'iPhone 15', 'company_key': None, 'start': 865, 'end': 874, 'score': 0.9925150871276851}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'iPhone 14', 'normalized': 'iPhone 14', 'company_key': None, 'start': 902, 'end': 911, 'score': 0.9938850998878471}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'China', 'normalized': 'China', 'company_key': None, 'start': 927, 'end': 932, 'score': 0.999779641628265}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 949, 'end': 954, 'score': 0.9986305236816401}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1157, 'score': 0.9987467527389521}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 1189, 'end': 1194, 'score': 0.9988914132118221}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'iPhone 15', 'normalized': 'iPhone 15', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1325, 'end': 1334, 'score': 0.997308135032653}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1411, 'score': 0.9985160231590271}]","{'negative': 0.9974821209907531, 'neutral': 0.0005164808244440001, 'positive': 0.002001456683501}","{'neutral': 0.43641373515129006, 'fear': 0.381062775850296, 'sadness': 0.07652647793292901, 'surprise': 0.06948298215866, 'anger': 0.018612999469041002, 'joy': 0.009778784587979001, 'disgust': 0.008122239261865}",2023/65effca0c762af1f05b838a69cca368a63f4618b42576b8bb6e72578d74fdd2d.json,12

Gemini is a next-gen, multimodal AI model that can process text, images, and audio.
It is being incorporated into Bard immediately, with a more advanced model set to launch next year.
Google has finally unveiled Gemini, its answer to OpenAI's GPT-4.
The tech is a next-gen, multimodal AI model developed by a team of researchers pulled from Google's now-merged AI divisions DeepMind and Google Brain.
The model is being promoted as a significant advancement in natural language processing, with Google calling it ""our largest science and engineering project ever.""
Users can access Gemini this month, with a more advanced version set to arrive early next year.
The drawn-out release has been closely watched by the tech world, with many speculating about the model's ability to better its main competitor, OpenAI's large language model GPT-4.
An analysis that made an early declaration for Google's AI supremacy over GPT-4 ignited a fierce online debate that even lured OpenAI CEO Sam Altman into the fray.
The model has three ""sizes,"" set to launch in stages. Here's what we know so far.
Gemini is multimodal
Google's Gemini is a multimodal AI, meaning it can process more than one data type.
The model can process images, text, audio, video, and coding languages. The new capabilities allow for features such as written analysis of visual graphs.
The tech giant is also boosting the tech's code-generating abilities to try and take on Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which is powered by OpenAI, The Information previously reported.
The first iteration of the model Gemini 1.0, is optimized for three sizes: Gemini Ultra, Pro, and Nano.
Inspired by AlphaGo
Gemini owes a debt to AlphaGo, which was developed by Google's DeepMind and became the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player. AI history was made back in 2016 when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, one of the world's greatest Go players, at his own game.
The techniques used in AlphaGo would be combined with the technology that powers ChatGPT, Demis Hassabis, the boss of DeepMind, told Wired in June.
""At a high level you can think of Gemini as combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models,"" he said.
Early versions
Google began handing out an early version of the model to a small group of companies in September, The Information reported.
One person who had tested the tech previously told the outlet it may have an advantage on GPT-4 because it leverages Google's data from consumer products, as well as information gathered from the internet. The addition should mean the model can more accurately understand the user's intentions, the report said.
The person also said the model appeared to generate fewer incorrect answers, a common problem in artificial intelligence known as hallucinations. AI-powered chatbots have been known to present incorrect information as fact. Back in February, Google's ad for ChatGPT rival Bard showed the AI chatbot giving an inaccurate answer.
Researchers behind the SemiAnalysis blog have also predicted that Google's Gemini would likely outperform GPT-4 because of Google's access to top-flight chips.",finance.yahoo.com,Here's what we know

The company is close to overtaking Elon Musk's company as the world's top seller of EVs.
But its stock price has tumbled 22% this year, dragged down by China's faltering economy.
BYD, a Chinese EV maker backed by Warren Buffett, plans to buy back 200 million yuan – around $28.2 million – worth of its own shares as it battles to put an end to its 2023 slump.
In a Wednesday Shenzhen Stock Exchange filing, chairman and CEO Wang Chuanfu said the buybacks are intended to safeguard shareholders, boost investor confidence, and stabilize BYD's valuation.
BYD is close to snatching Tesla's crown as the top seller of EVs worldwide, selling just 3,000 fewer EVs than Elon Musk's company in the three months to September 30.
But its stock price has tumbled 22% year-to-date amid worries that China's faltering economy will weigh on future demand for its cars.
The company has also slashed its prices in a bid to compete with local rivals like XPeng and new entrants to the EV market like Huawei. Some analysts believe the price cuts will chip away at profits, even if they boost sales.
Investors appeared reassured by BYD's stock buybacks. The company's Shenzhen-listed shares climbed 2.6% Wednesday and shares trading in Hong Kong closed 1.3% higher, according to data from Refinitiv.
Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway has cut its own stake in BYD by 60% since August 2022. The stock is down just under 20% since the Buffett's conglomerate started trimming its position.
Earlier this year, Buffett and his then-business partner Charlie Munger, who died last week aged 99, hinted that one reason they'd been offloading BYD shares was that they didn't want to do battle with Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk.
""We don't want to compete with Elon in a lot of things,"" Buffett told Berkshire's annual meeting in May.
""We don't want that much failure,"" Munger quickly added.",finance.yahoo.com,"A Chinese Tesla rival, backed by Warren Buffett, is buying back its own shares to stop a stock-market

What’s more, average monthly payments are continuing to increase as well, as interest rates rise. In the first quarter of 2023, the average monthly payment for a new vehicle increased to $730, from $656 the previous year. Used vehicles came in at $551 that same quarter, from $542, according to Edmunds. What’s more, 16.8% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in that quarter have a monthly payment of $1,000 or more — a new all-time high according to Edmunds — compared to 10.3% in the first quarter of 2022 and 6.2% in the first quarter of 2021.

Microsoft finalized the deal, the largest ever in the gaming market, on Oct. 13.
A court hearing in the agency's appeal of a failed injunction request is set to take place Wednesday in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In July, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suspended its administrative challenge to block the acquisition.
The suspension came after a federal district court judge and a three-judge federal appellate court panel declined to grant the FTC a preliminary injunction that would have kept the tie-up from moving forward while the agency completed an investigation into antitrust concerns.
Microsoft later reached an agreement with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to relinquish certain cloud gaming rights contained in its original plan, paving the way for the deal to close.
In its original complaint to block the deal, the FTC said that Microsoft's ownership of Activision ""would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.""
Those concerns stem in large part from the fact that the merger of the two companies makes Microsoft the third-largest video game company in the world by revenue behind Sony (SONY) and Tencent.
Microsoft published a statement on Tuesday arguing the FTC should drop its challenge, pointing to 37 venture capital firms that joined together to file a ""friend of the court"" to endorse the deal.
In the filing, Microsoft described the FTC’s legal position as a ""watered-down"" stance that would give the agency too much power to block transactions. Support from the venture firms, the company said, ""sent a clear message"" that the FTC's opposition ""threatens the cycle of investment and entrepreneurship that drives America’s innovation economy.""
Although the FTC can continue to fight the deal, courts generally shy away from unraveling integrated companies. The FTC has also said it intends to continue scrutinizing the deal using its internal administrative process.
""The FTC's been down that road,"" Brian Quinn, a Boston College Law School professor told Yahoo Finance.
""The remedies available include taking apart the merged companies, and that's also the remedy that nobody wants to do. No court wants to be in charge of taking a deal apart.""
The protracted legal battle comes amid an aggressive push by the Biden administration over the course of the year to challenge big tech's dominance in various markets.
The FTC argued in a court filing in November that Microsoft's acquisition would harm consumers by restructuring the gaming industry and likely giving Microsoft the ability and incentive to deny, delay, degrade, or foreclose rivals from accessing Activision's games.
""If Microsoft is given free rein to weaponize Activision's content, emerging markets for content library subscriptions and cloud gaming will be walled off and dominated by just a few large companies,"" the FTC wrote in its court filing.
In addition to its pressure on Microsoft, the FTC and US Justice Department has brought or continued antitrust suits against Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (META).",finance.yahoo.com,Microsoft set to face latest challenge from FTC over Activision

['Eric Kulisch'],2023-12-04 02:01:03+00:00,,2023-12-04 00:26:19,Alaska Airlines will inherit a cargo business for Amazon as part of its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. The post Alaska Airlines to fly Amazon packages after completing Hawaiian buy appeared first on FreightWaves.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Falaska-airlines-fly-amazon-packages-002619310.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/freightwaves_373/9efa7f735157f6ac43939901aa917db4,en,,"Alaska Air will take over cargo transportation for e-commerce giant Amazon when it concludes a deal announced Sunday to acquire Hawaiian Airlines in a stock-and-debt transaction worth $1.9 billion. Whether the Amazon transportation services agreement is eventually modified is unclear, but Alaska’s CEO said it could spur further investment in freighters.
“For now, nothing changes,” said Hawaiian Airlines spokesman Alex Da Silva in an email.
Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA) in early October began flying an Airbus A330-300 converted freighter between Amazon’s air logistics superhub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and its West Coast hub in San Bernardino, California. Under a contract inked late last year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) plans to lease nine more of the former passenger planes that are being overhauled to carry cargo containers and turn them over to Hawaiian to operate on its behalf in the domestic U.S. market.
The parent company of Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) presumably contemplated that Amazon has warrants to take a 15% equity stake in Hawaiian Airlines after nine years conditioned on meeting a spending threshold of $1.8 billion.
Operating freighters for the first time in a partnership with Amazon is a way for Hawaiian to diversify its business.
Alaska Airlines has long operated a small fleet of freighter aircraft, primarily between Alaska and the continental United States. It currently has four converted freighters — three Boeing 737-700s and one 737-800 it received last month. Boeing is scheduled to deliver a second 737-800 passenger-to-freighter aircraft early next year. But the A330, a medium widebody aircraft, is much larger than the 737 and would bring Alaska’s freighter fleet to 15 aircraft by early 2025.
“We will be closely assessing whether further dedicated freight or flying for ourselves or in an asset light model for others could make sense for the combined company over time,” said Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci on a conference call with analysts.
“We haven’t had a ton of conversation with Amazon,” he added. “We’re anxious to understand that more. We are the only passenger carrier in the U.S. industry that has dedicated freighter flying today, removing from three aircraft of five. I think it’s an area of potential longer term opportunity for the company. And we’ll continue to watch to see if that type of flying makes more sense if there’s more of it.”
The Amazon partnership also gives Alaska Airlines a Midwest pilot base and more opportunities for pilots to fly widebody aircraft, which offer more lucrative pay.
“Alaska has a strong track record of operating a good freighter network and is also an airline known for strong operational reliability. However, the executive team at Hawaiian was strong supporters of the Amazon deal. Many of those leaders may not survive the merger, so Alaska executives will need to prove their commitment to Amazon for the long run,” Derek Lossing, the founder of Cirrus Global Advisors and former Amazon Logistics executive, told FreightWaves.
Executives said on a call with investors that they expect the deal to provide $20 million in redundant savings from cargo operations associated with their respective passenger airlines, which carry cargo in the lower hold as an adjunct business, and potentially unlock further growth.
Bigger is better
The rationale for merging Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines stems from the fact that they are mid-tier carriers in a competitive U.S. airline market where scale increasingly matters. Also, Hawaiian has routes to Asia that give Alaska Airlines access to its first major international presence, beyond limited flights to Mexico and Central America.
Alaska Airlines already flies to Hawaii but will offer expanded service there and count Honolulu as a major hub.
The companies said they will maintain their existing brands, with a combined fleet of 365 aircraft. The Alaska and Hawaiian networks are highly complementary, with only a 3% overlap. Alaska operates an all-Boeing narrowbody fleet while Hawaiian has a mixed fleet that includes 24 A330s and 18 Airbus A321neos.
Alaska appears to have received a good value for its money, with the deal worth less than Hawaiian’s annual revenue and a price-to-earnings ratio of four.
During the first three quarters of 2023, Alaska Airlines generated $10.4 billion in revenue compared to $2.8 billion for Hawaiian.
The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, pending approval by Hawaiian shareholders and antitrust regulators.

While students at North Carolina Central, a historically Black university in Durham, N.C., Belvin and Branch came up with the idea to sell Black empowerment T-shirts through their now-defunct label “HBCU Made.” It was during that time they also had the idea to create a sneaker museum.
“We wanted a creative way to tell the Black story of different topics and the movement of America,” Belvin told the Chicago Tribune. “Selfie museums were really huge (at the time).”
The two studied marketing in college, and after graduation Belvin, a Detroit native, came to Chicago to start a museum while Branch initially returned home to Baltimore to open one. They chose Chicago, they said, because they could list brands and people who got their start in the city and they hoped to become a part of it.
Branch eventually joined Belvin in Chicago, and they focused on getting a single museum off the ground.
“(We wanted to) dive into Instagram culture, fashion and things like that,” Belvin said. “The Black story is really tied into that, and a lot of people don’t realize how much influence we have.”
In addition to storytelling, they added customization classes in which visitors could document their own bit of sneaker history.
“Our exhibit started out as just a museum, and it kind of told the backstory of the greatest sneakers that were dropped in history,” Belvin said. “And then from there, as we started deep diving into the actual creators and the people behind the brands, that’s when we realized people should be able to tell their story too.”
A little more than a year after its modest opening, The SHU Experience led more than 100 members of the Chicago Bears organization in customizing Nike Air Force Ones as part of the NFL’s My Cause, My Cleats initiative.
It’s the eighth year NFL players have an opportunity to participate in the campaign, which allows them to design and wear custom cleats that support a charitable organization of their choice. But for the first time, everyone associated with the Bears was invited to participate.
For Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field, Bears players will wear cleats customized to represent causes near and dear to their heart. And Bears employees will wear their custom sneakers.
Bears Chairman George McCaskey and President and CEO Kevin Warren are participating, with their shoes painted by members of the organization who paint sneakers as a hobby. Warren’s sneakers were customized in support of the Warren Family Foundation.
“It’s important because a lot of us as an organization — and then the individuals that we have, from players and coaches to staff to ownership — are able to amplify causes that are near and dear to each one of us,” Warren told the Tribune, “and to do it in a manner that brings awareness to just how blessed we are and the positive impact of the Chicago Bears of what we can have in the community.”
The idea for the organization-wide event came from the Bears Young Professionals Employee Resource Group, led by partnership activation specialist Dominic Hillesheim and events coordinator Lorena Soria.
“We thought My Cause, My Cleats symbolizes everything that we’re trying to create because shoes don’t discriminate at all,” Hillesheim said. “Every single person, whether it’s a flip-flop or a boot, everybody has to wear a pair of shoes. Everybody also had a cause that was close to their heart, whether they knew about it right away or they had to research it a little bit.”
Soria, who describes herself as “a huge sneaker person,” learned about Sneakerhead University on TikTok. Mallorie Sanders, the Bears manager of diversity, equity and inclusion, said the museum’s mission aligned with the team’s community-based values.
Sneakerhead University’s museum now includes multiple rooms of immersive sneaker history — including a “real versus fake” exhibit — and hosts both private and ticketed (open to the public) customization classes and parties.
According to Branch, when the Bears reached out to them, they thought they would just be putting the team logo on the shoes. They had no idea they would be doing something so meaningful for so many.
“We didn’t realize how many people wanted a piece of them on their shoes,” Branch said. “We’ve seen a lot of stories. It’s been cool seeing them develop.”
In November, SHU held workshops at both the Bears offices in the Loop and at Halas Hall in Lake Forest. Team employees supported charitable organizations such as Easter Seals, Special Olympics and their kids’ schools. They spent hours coming up with designs and painting their shoes.
At an unboxing event Wednesday at Halas Hall, staffers excitedly saw their finished sneakers and shared their causes.
“When we start working on the shoes, it starts off as the blue-and-green shoe or the red-and-yellow shoe,” Belvin said. “And then after it’s, ‘Where’s Larry’s shoe?’ because you almost feel like you know the person.”
Bears running back Khalil Herbert is participating in My Cause, My Cleats, though he didn’t paint his own shoes. His cleats were customized in support of Heartland Animal Shelter.
“I chose Heartland because of my love for animals, specifically dogs,” Herbert said. “I have two dogs and just wanted to bring awareness to the shelter. They do a great job of bringing in a lot of these dogs from kill shelters and giving them another opportunity in a second home.”
He learned about Heartland, located in Wheeling, through his dog sitter when he needed a place to donate extra toys and treats, and he has since visited twice. Herbert’s blue cleats feature painted paw prints and pictures of his dogs, Khazi and Khace.
He wasn’t the only animal lover whose shoes stood out.
“There’s someone whose shoes are about his cat,” Branch said. “And you can tell he really loves cats. He put all the cats he’s ever had on a sneaker. That really stuck out to me.”
For others, customizing their shoes was an opportunity to pay homage to a lost friend or relative. As they showed colleagues their shoes, you could see the emotion in their faces. Belvin and Branch talked with people about their shoes and helped lace them properly, making sure every detail was just right for their big moment Sunday.
The event with the Bears was SHU’s largest to date, an opportunity for which Belvin and Branch said they are grateful. By helping members of the organization tell their stories, they got to add to their own.

Jørn Eggum, the head of Fellesforbundet, or the United Federation of Trade Unions, said if Tesla doesn’t accept the demand from Sweden's powerful metalworkers’ union IF Metall by Dec. 20, “we will proceed with the implementation of boycott actions.” Fellesforbundet is organizing, among others, employees in car repair workshops.
“This is a clear signal to Tesla that they cannot transport Swedish Teslas through Norway,” Eggum said, adding it was too early to say exactly which measures will be implemented. If they attempt it anyway, “it will be met with actions, and we will take the measures necessary to make this work.”
Dock workers at Sweden’s four largest ports already have stopped the delivery of Tesla vehicles in solidarity with the 130 members of IF Metall who walked out on Oct. 27, at seven workshops across Sweden where the popular electric cars are serviced.
Several Swedish unions, including postal workers, have since joined in a wave of solidarity with IF Metall’s demands.
Tesla, which is non-unionized globally, has no manufacturing plant in Sweden but has several service centers.
The move comes a day after the United Federation of Workers in neighboring Denmark said there had been speculation that Tesla would deliver its cars to Danish ports and transport them on trucks to Sweden after Swedish dock workers blocked the reception of Tesla cars there.
The head of Norway's Fellesforbundet, which claims to have nearly 170,000 members, said Swedish union members were taking up “the fight against a union-hostile company.”",finance.yahoo.com,A group of

For JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Brazil’s biggest banks, the exodus has generated asset and client growth. For Morgan Stanley, not so much.
Wealth under management in Miami from Mexico clients alone increased by roughly 10% this year at JPMorgan, with similar gains coming from Argentina, Chile, Peru and several other Latin American nations, according to the firm.
“It’s incredible how much we’ve grown here in Miami,” Marice Brown, head of Mexico private banking at the New York-based company, said in an interview. “It was really hard to bring people to Miami in terms of talent, and now after the pandemic it’s the other way around,” she said, adding that this year the bank recruited enough new people to boost its workforce dedicated to Mexicans by 10%, to about 120 employees.
JPMorgan oversees about $180 billion from the region, managed from booking centers in Miami, Houston, New York and Geneva. As investors shift their fortunes, the Wall Street firm plans to expand its Latin American private-banking business into another floor in a Miami building at 1450 Brickell Ave.
Brazil’s biggest banks are sharing in the boom. Banco Bradesco SA increased its headcount in the Miami area to 230 from 190 after acquiring a bank in Coral Gables in 2019. Its total wealth under custody in Florida has doubled to $4 billion since 2019.
And Sao Paulo-based Itau Unibanco Holding SA saw its wealth under management climb about 10% in the city this year, to roughly $24 billion. The bank opened more than 1,000 accounts there in 2023. It also hired Fernando Marques from Banque Pictet & Cie SA in Zurich and moved him to Miami this month to become commercial head for private banking in the city.
Morgan Stanley has been the exception. The Wall Street giant has been losing clients and bankers in Miami amid a Federal Reserve review of the firm’s measures to prevent potential money laundering by wealth clients from outside the US, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm closed some accounts and stopped opening new ones from Latin American clients, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.
Morgan Stanley is also changing its policy regarding those clients. Starting in the second half of 2024, the required account minimum for clients from Panama and Bolivia will increase to $10 million from $2 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The minimum for costumers in markets including Brazil, Chile and Mexico will fall by half to $1 million, but the bank will no longer open new accounts for people in Venezuela and Nicaragua, the person said.
A Morgan Stanley spokesperson confirmed the changes to the account minimums, saying the bank remains “committed” to its international wealth business, but has developed targeted client models “that reflect appropriate risk considerations.”

With interest rates still high in the US, and with prospects the Fed may soon start to cut them, many investors are seeking dollar-denominated corporate bonds or Treasuries, Brown at JPMorgan said. Private credit is also attracting attention.
JPMorgan’s team in Miami dedicated to clients from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia has expanded about 10% this year, to 70 people, according to Ezequiel Lazcano, head of Latin America south at JPMorgan’s private bank. JPMorgan focuses on Latin American clients with about $10 million or more to invest with the firm.
“We saw a significant geographic portfolio reallocation to Miami related to the fact that our clients have found more compelling opportunities to multiply their wealth in the US than in some of their countries,” Lazcano said.
Another impetus for the Miami push has been a shift to leftist governments in Chile, Peru and Colombia, which sparked a capital flight from those nations as investors searched for safe havens, according to Carlos Gribel, head of Andbank’s brokerage firm in Miami. Andbank has been attracting $150 million of inflows a year to its $1.4 billion wealth under management in Miami, mostly from from those nations.
“The movement from Brazilians is slower, because of high local interest rates and stable political conditions, but when compared to historical outflows we see that they are also increasing their share of offshore investments in their portfolios,” Gribel said.
For other banks, demand from Brazilians has been extraordinary.
“This has been one of the more active years ever in our history in terms of clients doing exchange-rate conversions to invest abroad,” said Fernando Beyruti, global head of Itau’s private-banking unit, the biggest in Brazil’s onshore markets.
Percy Moreira, head of international private banking at Itau, said the bank is “seeing absurd demand from our clients for global investment diversification, mainly now that interest rates outside Brazil have increased a bit.”
With a mortgage portfolio of $2.3 billion, Bradesco is the lead bank in Florida in the business of financing real estate properties for non-resident individuals in the US, said Henrique Lima, chief executive officer at Bradesco Bank.
“We will keep growing this business, which has good profitability and delinquency rates close to zero,” Lima said. “The Miami market is still hot, and local crises in Latin America help to increase this type of lending, since many people like to take their money out of their nation and invest in something as solid as bricks in the US.”

The company in June 2022 increased the maximum amount providers of such information could receive from 1 million yuan to 5 million yuan, saying that policy was valid for a year. The minimum amount is 50,000 yuan.
""The evidence we collect includes but is not limited to chat records, emails, contracts, fund transfers and other information,"" the company said in a Weibo post. ""Such information should be legally effective and BYD will give the provider a generous reward once it verifies it to be true.""
BYD did not say why it extended the reward programme, which it introduced in late 2021, saying it wanted to combat online smear campaigns and to protect the company's brand image. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Monday.
In September, the company hit back against online discussions that said BYD had leaked commercial secrets, saying those posts were pure rumours. It added that the police had apprehended the person responsible for spreading the rumour and that the company planned to take legal action.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD is China's largest seller of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and Tesla's closest rival in the global electric vehicle sales race.
The company, which has been expanding overseas along with several other Chinese EV makers, broke records with new energy vehicle (NEV) sales rising 53% year-on-year to 824,001 in the third quarter, according to company data.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The company has faced several quarters of sales decline for Macs and iPads, which together account for nearly 15% of its revenue, as sticky inflation and high borrowing costs force consumers to dial back non-essential purchases.
Apple gave a holiday-quarter sales forecast last month that was below Wall Street estimates due to weakness in demand for iPads and wearables. Meanwhile, its Mac business has been grappling with a wider slump in the personal computer market.
The Bloomberg News report said the iPads are expected to be launched around the end of March, and that the company is also working on revamped versions of the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard accessories for the Pro model of the device.

They came with a singular mission: reaching an agreement to regulate artificial intelligence. And they didn’t quite get there. But the EU’s internal market chief, Thierry Breton, didn’t want a long break over the weekend that would give lobbyists more time to weigh in, according to people familiar with the matter.
It took yet another round of intense bargaining on Friday, curtains drawn and under the glare of bright lights, for the group to reach consensus.
Just before midnight, representatives announced they’d finally struck a deal to control a technology that Elon Musk, OpenAI Inc.’s Sam Altman, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton and others have warned could pose an existential threat if left unchecked.
Europe’s pact on the so-called AI Act ushers in a pivotal time, one in which world leaders will demonstrate their ability — and their appetite — for regulating AI technologies and keeping their potential for bias, privacy violations, outsized influence and other risks at bay. No moment has better captured the dilemma that governments face in doing this without snuffing out beneficial AI technologies than the debates that raged on for days in Europe.
Some have suggested “that AI cannot be governed, either because lawmakers don’t understand the technology or because the technology evolves so fast,” Anu Bradford, a professor at Columbia Law School’s European Legal Studies Center, said Friday. While the EU’s policy faces headwinds, she said, the region had “the opportunity to show that it cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”

Outside of China and India, efforts to regulate AI have been limited. Some US cities and states have passed legislation restricting use of the technology in certain areas such as police investigations and hiring. Various federal agencies are vetting the use of AI tools, some regulators are using existing laws to police the technology and members of the US Congress are exploring legislation. But the nation is nowhere close to introducing a bill like the EU’s AI Act.
The policy making its way through the EU’s legislative process extends far beyond the generative AI tools that have captured the world’s attention in the past year. It would dictate exactly how law enforcement is allowed to use AI-powered surveillance cameras; how it can be deployed in critical infrastructure; and how the developers of programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard will be held responsible for mitigating the risks of their systems.
It would also come with some teeth. Policymakers are proposing to impose penalties on companies that violate the rules, with fines up to €35 million ($37.7 million), or 7% of global turnover, depending on the infringement and the size of the company.

Both the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states will need to approve the agreement. But the deal reached Friday marks a critical step toward clearing landmark AI policy that will — in the absence of any meaningful action by US Congress — set the tone for deliberations and ensuing regulation in the western world.
The EU — like other governments — struggled to strike a balance between the desire to preserve its own AI startups, such as France’s Mistral AI and Germany’s Aleph Alpha, and potential societal risks. That proved to be a key sticking point in negotiations, with some countries including France and Germany opposing rules that they said would unnecessarily handicap local companies.
Some details still need to be worked out by civil servants in the coming weeks, but negotiators largely agreed to place guardrails around generative AI, establishing basic transparency requirements for any developer of the large models that power them.
What surprised many was the fact that the most contentious discussions revolved around live biometric identification tools, the kind that can scan and recognize people’s faces in real-time, and not generative AI. But the issue has been a long-running, emotional debate. The parliament voted for a complete ban of the tools last spring, while EU countries have been pushing for exemptions for national security and law enforcement.

In the end, the two sides agreed to limit the use of the technology in public spaces with more guardrails.
Some took Europe’s long and drawn-out debates as a sign that policymakers are deliberating with more thought and less haste. “We spent a lot of time on finding the right balance,” Breton said in a statement early Saturday.

The days-long discussions this week were held in an attempt to reach a deal and get the legislation cleared before European elections in June usher in a new commission and parliament that could stall efforts.
France’s digital minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, said his government will review the compromise in the coming weeks to ensure it “preserves Europe’s capacity to develop its own artificial intelligence technologies.” Artigas, Spain’s secretary of state for digitization and artificial intelligence, noted that, under the deal, French AI startup Mistral likely wouldn’t be subject to controls around general-purpose AI systems while it’s still in the research and development phase.
At the end of the talks, Artigas was said to have popped open a bottle of champagne. “We are hopeful,” she said, that “they all will confirm.”

Factors Affecting a Car’s Value
Several factors affect your car’s value, including its condition, history and market demand. Let’s look at these factors and why they matter to prospective buyers.
Accident History
A vehicle that has never been in an accident typically sells for more than an identical vehicle in a fender bender. Similarly, a severe accident that left structural damage (even if it’s been repaired) lowers the vehicle’s value.
Brand, Make and Model
People who love a specific brand, make or model tend to be more willing to pay a higher price to get the vehicle they want. Some cars and trucks fetch a higher asking price than others, which varies regionally. For example, Edmunds reports the Toyota Corolla is the most popular vehicle in Florida, while Ford F-150 trucks reign in Colorado and Tesla dominates the California market.
Maintenance
A well-maintained vehicle typically holds more value than a spotty maintenance history. Regular oil changes, routine coolant flushes and periodic air conditioning service keep vehicles in working order and show prospective buyers you’ve taken care of the vehicle.
Market Conditions
Changes in the market affect vehicle values. For example, demand for compact cars with good gas mileage and hybrid vehicles increases when gas prices rise. During the Covid pandemic, chip shortages lowered the supply of new cars and helped send used car prices to record highs.
Mileage
Years ago, cars that reached the 100,000 mark lost significant value as buyers shied away from them to avoid potentially costly repairs. Today, the average used car has around 70,000 miles, and some dealerships take in cars with up to 150,000 miles as trades. However, a vehicle with lower miles usually sells for a higher price than a similar vehicle with more miles.
Type of Sale
In many cases, selling a car to a private individual costs more than trading it into a dealer. This is because the dealer will spend money to prepare the vehicle for sale, including inspecting and reconditioning the vehicle and paying for expenses related to the transaction.
Vehicle Condition
Buyers consider the vehicle’s condition when deciding to pay the asking price. Torn seats, scratches, dents, rust, and mechanical problems lower the value. On the other hand, you should see the value increase if the vehicle is in good physical condition.
Vehicle Options
Car valuation models take into consideration the options available on the vehicle. Popular features like power windows and air conditioning may be necessary for some buyers, and a vehicle lacking them would be worth less. Vehicles with high-end interiors and technology typically hold their value longer, but be careful about aftermarket modifications. You may like super dark tinted windows, but a buyer who prefers more visibility at night might not be willing to pay for it.

The first step in finding out the exact value of your car is to evaluate it objectively. According to Kelly Blue Book, owners overvalue their vehicles when setting an asking price. Note features like sunroof, audio system, trim package, engine, and powertrain. You’ll need these details later.
When choosing the vehicle’s condition, you can use the guidelines provided by the pricing guide you’re using. For example, Edmunds uses the following category descriptions:
Outstanding: These vehicles are new and do not need to be cleaned or reconditioned by the new owner. The vehicle has no mechanical issues or visible wear inside.
Clean: A clean car may show signs of normal wear and tear, like a slightly faded interior or minor paint scratches. These cars have no significant mechanical problems and need no work to pass an emissions test.
Average: Average vehicles may have cosmetic or mechanical issues, such as dull paint, minor dents, and worn interior fabric. However, they still should be able to pass an emissions test.
Rough: These vehicles typically have serious mechanical and cosmetic concerns that the new owner needs to repair, but the vehicle still runs. For example, a vehicle with a damaged exhaust may operate, but it needs to be repaired to be in good operating condition. The interior needs work, like reupholstered seats or a replaced dash.
Damaged: Vehicles in this category usually do not run properly and need significant cosmetic and mechanical work. This can include frame damage, a branded title, or serious rust.
Classic Cars
Calculating the value of a classic car can be tricky because the actual cash value doesn’t reflect what it’s worth in the market. Classic car buyers look at the make and model, condition, and trim package, but they may be willing to pay more for a vehicle that elicits a sense of nostalgia in them–like a replica of their first car. Supply and demand also play a role, as the number of available classic car models decreases over time.
Where Can I Find the Best Value for My Car?
You can use several pricing guides and consult with more than one guide to give you a more precise value. Some popular online car value calculators include the following:
Carfax
Edmunds
Kelly Blue Book
JD Power
Another place to check vehicle values is through online and local marketplaces where people list vehicles for sale. Just remember the list price is the asking price and does not reflect what the seller is willing to accept and what buyers are willing to pay.
Final Take — What Your Car Value Means When It’s Time To Sell
Ultimately, your car’s value is what someone else is willing to pay. Pricing guides are a tool to help you gauge what to expect, but they don’t guarantee a value. When setting a sale price, consider multiple factors like the outstanding balance on the car loan (if you still have one), what you plan to do with the money (and how much you need to do it) and whether your description of the vehicle lines up with how others view it.

The seven companies focused on technology megatrends -- Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla -- have absolutely obliterated the S&P 500:
Data source: Ycharts.
The tech trends driving their market-crushing returns (e.g., artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce, and electric vehicles) still have long growth runways ahead. That could give the Magnificent Seven the power to continue outperforming. However, instead of buying all seven stocks, investors could consider taking an even more passive approach by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a high concentration of those stocks. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) stands out for its outsized exposure to the Magnificent Seven.
What is the Invesco QQQ Trust?
The Invesco QQQ launched more than two decades ago. It tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, an index of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The Invesco QQQ has grown into one of the largest ETFs by assets under management (AUM). It currently holds over $220 billion of client assets, making it one of the five largest ETFs by AUM in the world. It's the second-most traded ETF in the U.S. by average trading volume, showcasing its popularity among investors.
The ETF has also been a top performer over the years. It has delivered an average annualized total return of 17% over the last decade, compared to a nearly 10% average annual total return for the S&P 500. This ETF would have grown a $10,000 investment made a decade ago into nearly $50,000 today. For comparison, the same investment in an S&P 500 index would have grown to only roughly $30,000.
Driving that outperformance is the underlying growth of the companies in the index. That group has grown much faster than other benchmarks over the past 10 years:
10-year compound annual growth rates. Data source: Invesco.
Concentration has played a key role in the index's outsized growth. It holds 100 companies (as opposed to 500 or 1,000) heavily weighted toward faster-growing stock market sectors (technology made up 57% of its holdings). That concentration on companies benefiting from major growth trends has helped power faster financial growth and higher shareholder returns.
A magnificent way to play the Magnificent Seven
The Invesco QQQ Trust is in an excellent position to continue outperforming because it concentrates on companies with outsized growth prospects. It all starts at the top. The fund's top holdings are the Magnificent Seven stocks:
Apple: 10.8% of the fund's holdings.
Microsoft: 9.5%
Amazon: 5.3%.
Nvidia: 4.3%
Meta Platforms: 3.8%.
Tesla: 3.2%.
Alphabet: 3.1% (class A shares) and 3.1% (class C shares)
Overall, those seven companies comprise 43% of the fund's holdings, with the other 93 stocks making up the remaining 57%. That's almost double their weighting in the S&P 500 (and related S&P 500-focused ETFs). Given their outsized weighting in the index, these companies are helping drive higher returns relative to the S&P 500.
The group has outperformed the market this year. According to data from Goldman Sachs, they had gained an average of 71% through mid-November compared to a 6% average gain for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index. If it weren't for the Magnificent Seven's outsized gains and large allocation, the index wouldn't have rallied 19% this year.
Goldman Sachs expects the Magnificent Seven to have another strong year in 2024, predicting they will again outperform the S&P 500. An analyst at the investment bank wrote that ""The seven stocks have faster expected sales growth, higher margins, a greater reinvestment ratio, and stronger balance sheets than the other 493 stocks and trade at a relative valuation in line with recent averages after accounting for expected growth."" Given the Nasdaq-00's higher weighting to this group, the Invesco QQQ is an excellent way to play their potential continued outperformance.
Concentrated at the top
The Invesco QQQ has been a great ETF investment over the years. It has delivered outsize returns for its investors because it concentrates on owning some of the fastest-growing companies benefiting from tech megatrends. That makes this ETF a great way to passively invest in the Magnificent Seven.

See, since the inception of the index 37 years ago, it has only fallen in consecutive years on one occasion: during the dot-com crash between 2000 and 2002.
True to form, the Nasdaq-100 has bounced back with a whopping 47% gain this year. But investors will be pleased to know that bodes very well for 2024. In fact, rebound years like 2023 have always been followed by another positive year.
There have been four such occurrences since 1986, and they delivered an average gain of 21.5%. That's the return investors could enjoy if history repeats.
Falling interest rates could send the market soaring in 2024
Consumers have been under pressure from elevated inflation and rising interest rates for the last two years. The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates at the fastest pace in its history between March 2022 and August 2023, sending the federal funds rate from a historic low of 0.25% to 5.50%.
Tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has felt the pinch, because despite its heavily diversified business spanning cloud computing, streaming services, and digital advertising, e-commerce (retail) is still its largest source of revenue.
But the tide might be turning. Experts predict the Fed will cut interest rates five times in 2024, which will bring welcome relief to consumers across America. But that isn't the only reason to get excited about Amazon stock. Here's why it could be one of the best buys for the new year.
Amazon's e-commerce segment could roar back to life in 2024
Amazon generated $220 billion in online sales during 2022, which was a drop of 1% compared to the prior year. But 2023 has been more positive as the pace of rate hikes slowed and more certainty crept into consumer households.
Through the first nine months of the year, Amazon's online sales have ticked up by 3.8%. While it seems like a modest increase, growth has accelerated in every quarter so far and hit 6% in Q3 (ended Sept. 30).
That acceleration bodes well heading into a new year with interest rate cuts on the horizon, because consumers will likely feel more confident about spending. But that isn't the only reason Amazon could do well in 2024; the company has also improved its processes to make its e-commerce business more efficient.
Earlier this year, Amazon split its U.S. national fulfillment network into eight regions. These regional clusters will hold more local inventory and streamline logistics so goods travel shorter distances to reach customers. The changes have already led to the fastest delivery times in Amazon's history, and the company believes this will lead to more sales. Plus, the increases in efficiency could save Amazon money over the long term.
Amazon is emerging as a leader in artificial intelligence
Amazon has spent much of 2023 focusing on artificial intelligence (AI), which could be one of its greatest financial opportunities ever. Most of the company's investments in AI are handled by its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which manages the data centers and software applications required to serve businesses all over the world.
See, Amazon wants to dominate AI from top to bottom. It developed its own data center chips called Trainium and Inferentia, which are designed to compete with Nvidia's industry-leading hardware. Plus, Amazon wants to offer the most powerful large language models to businesses, so that they choose AWS when they want to develop their own AI applications.
To accelerate its progress, Amazon recently invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider, it will train its future large language models using Amazon's chips, and it will make those models available on the AWS platform for customers to use.
Depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, AI could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to global economic output over the next decade thanks to its ability to boost productivity. It's crucial for Amazon to stake a claim in that enormous market, considering its competitors -- namely, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud -- are also investing billions of dollars in the space.
Why Amazon stock could be a top performer in 2024
Amazon is the cheapest stock among its trillion-dollar peers based on a traditional valuation metric called the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. It measures a company's revenue compared to its market capitalization.
Based on Amazon's $570 billion in expected total revenue for 2023 and its current market cap of $1.5 trillion, its stock trades at a P/S ratio of just 2.6. By comparison:
Apple stock trades at a P/S ratio of 8.1.
Microsoft stock sports a P/S ratio of 12.8.
Alphabet (Google) stock trades at a P/S ratio of 6.2.
Nvidia stock has a P/S ratio of 36.3.
But here's the kicker: Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, including Apple, the largest company in the world (it produced $383 billion in sales in fiscal 2023 ended Sept. 30).
Growth is a key determinant of the P/S ratio; the faster a company grows, the higher the valuation investors are willing to pay. Amazon's total revenue decelerated in 2022 and only increased by 9%, partly because of its lagging e-commerce segment.
But the company is on track to boost its revenue by 11% in 2023, and it could grow by more than 11% in 2024, according to early estimates on Wall Street. By comparison, Apple is expected to increase its revenue by just 3.5% in its current fiscal 2024 year, and 5.7% in fiscal 2025.
But don't forget that Amazon is also positioning itself as a key player in the AI space, which could be the largest financial opportunity in the company's 29-year history. Therefore, I think its stock deserves more credit, and if it manages to close the P/S gap to its peers in 2024, that alone could drive significant gains for investors.

The Access Controller is a ""highly customisable kit"" of different buttons, triggers and sticks that lets players create a set-up that suits their needs.
Microsoft's Adaptive Controller, which can be used on Xbox and PC, has been on the market since 2018.
But this is the first device of its type to be specifically designed by Sony for the PS5.
""The idea is that you unbox it and you can start using it right away as a PlayStation controller,"" Alvin Daniel, Senior Technical Program Manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment, told the BBC.
""To the extent that this works for you and is comfortable for you, there is no need for you to purchase additional third party accessories and buttons and wire it all together.
""We wanted an all-inclusive kit in a box.""
But designing accessibility products is a massive task, as every disabled person's impairment is unique to them, and gaming technology is always evolving.
Sony's plan to tackle this problem is through customisation - making it possible for each person to tailor the solution to their own individual requirements.
Mr Daniel said the firm had teamed up with accessibility experts AbleGamers in the US to find ways round that problem.
""When they came up with their own bespoke solutions for various players, they would inevitably try to address three issues - the thumbsticks, pressing buttons, or having to hold the controller.
""If you have challenges in those three areas, this controller will help regardless of your underlying condition.""
How it plays
By Paul Carter, Technology reporter
All aspects of the Access Controller have clearly been designed with the input of the disabled community.
Even the packaging is accessible, and the setup process, while clunky at times, lets people adapt the controller to their own specific requirements, and even create different profiles for different games or situations.
As a disabled gamer myself, I waited years for button remapping to become the norm so I was able to play games that rely heavily on the trigger buttons usually placed at the back of a traditional controller, and be able to map them to a more accessible button.
But this was always a workaround rather than a solution. This controller makes that a more accessible reality.
There are however one or two design decisions that are, at best, bewildering - for example, it doesn't feature a right stick that is standard on all modern controllers and fairly essential to many genres of game.
I tried to play Spider-Man 2 - which has a Deaf character - and it was practically unplayable. The only solutions are to use the Access Controller alongside a regular PS5 controller, which is an unwieldy set-up, or use two Access Controllers together - which becomes an expensive solution.
That said, this product, and others like it, are a positive step forward for disabled gamers. That it exists, and that it has been co-designed with and for disabled people shows that gaming accessibility is now a mainstream issue.
I hope that this is the start of an evolution of these types of products, and that manufacturers listen to feedback and continue to iterate and innovate.
The gaming industry has been under pressure to make improvements for disabled players.
In the last few years, racing sim Forza Horizon 5 introduced a sign language feature, the Last of Us Part II has a mode for blind and deaf players, and Just Dance has a routine suitable for players in wheelchairs.
But the hardware options have been slim for those with disabilities, and Mr Daniel said Sony's new controller was about addressing that.
""I think particularly if you're a young person today, gaming is such a big part of popular culture, that you are socially isolated or you're left behind if you can't participate in the same experiences your friends or your schoolmates are doing"", he said.

Find Out: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases
With so many people scrolling the internet for sales, online retailers are dishing out discounts on a variety of items. It can all get overwhelming. What product sectors will feature the most appealing deals, and which departments are coming up short by comparison?

Sponsored: Open a new checking account and earn early paycheck access; up to 2 days early with Discover® Cashback Debit with Early Pay
Consider the Discounted Electronics
According to DataFeedWatch, electronics are sporting an average discount of 38.02%. The influx of discounts in this sector could be tied to consumer resistance around buying these more expensive items, in part because of the effects of inflation, the report noted.
So far, we’re seeing excellent deals specifically on TVs, smartwatches and even Apple products, which historically seldom go on sale.
Skip the Discounted Food and Beverages
The DataFeedWatch report points to an underwhelming assortment of discounts in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. The average discounts in this sector hover at around 18%.

Consider the Discounted Media
Media items are seeing very impressive sales, with the average discount in this sector standing at 37.9%. You can find jaw-dropping deals on streaming services including Paramount+, Hulo and Fubo.
Skip the Discounted Hardware
Hardware isn’t seeing the kind of deals one might hope for. According to the DataFeedWatch findings, the average discount in this sector is 21.86%.
Consider the Discounted Apparel and Accessories
Now is a good time to jump on deals in the category of apparel and accessories. The average discount in this sector is 37.71%. H&M, Macy’s. Forever 21 and Nordstrom stand strong in this department when it comes to deals.
Skip the Discounted Toys and Games
Toys and games can be a big part of the holidays, particularly if the people on your gift list include kids and teens. But the deals here are less than stellar, with the average discount weighing in at 21.22%.
Consider the Discounted Luggage and Bags
‘Tis the season for holiday travel, and it’s also a prime time to look into purchasing luggage and bags, which tout the average discount of 33.43%. Macy’s is a strong contender for deals here, as are JCPenney and Kohl’s.
Skip the Discounted Business and Industrial Supplies
It’s not a great time to buy all those business and industrial supplies on sale. The discount in this sector is just 21.81%.
Consider the Discounted Home and Garden Items
In the midst of renovating your place? Or doing some landscaping work? Look into home and garden items on sale — they’re touting an average discount of 31.08%. Wayfair, Temu and Home Depot are competing intensely with solid deals.
Skip the Furniture
Sadly, the furniture deals aren’t totally superb; the average discount in this category is 26.92%. It’s not terrible, but also not as good as it could be.
Consider the Discounted Arts and Entertainment
Experiential gifts for the win! In the sector of arts and entertainment, you can find discounts averaging around 33.01%. Check out Walmart, Amazon and Costco, for starters.
Skip the Discounted Animal and Pet Supplies
Fido and Felix and all the other furry friends may not have the greatest holidays, judging by the deals at least. According to this research, discounts in this department average 22.82%.
Consider the Discounted Vehicles and Parts
Just making GOBankingRates’ cut for stellar discounts is the category of vehicles and parts, which boast an average discount of 30.12%. CarParts.com is participating in the deals momentum right now, as is Walmart and Amazon.
Skip the Discounted Health and Beauty Stuff
The health and beauty sector can be strangely stingy when it comes to big deals. Unsurprisingly, discounts in this department average 27.38%. Again, not terrible, but perhaps also not worth your time when you can get fatter savings elsewhere.

He said lower taxes, better weather, and more space all make Miami attractive compared to Manhattan.
The exec is moving to Miami from NYC in early 2024, and said ""probably nothing"" could keep him from leaving.
There's a debate brewing about the future of New York City as the financial center of the world — and over which city could replace it.
While Manhattan is home to Wall Street and its mainstays, a question has come up in recent years as to whether the longstanding finance capital is destined to shift south.
Billionaire Ken Griffin said in November that Miami could soon overtake New York City as the dominant hub for markets and finance professionals. He moved the headquarters of his hedge fund, Citadel, to the Sunshine State last year from Chicago.
To Rahul Sen Sharma, the New York-based president and co-chief executive of Indxx, a financial markets index provider and data firm, it's no longer a question as to where he wants to live for work. Every single employee at his company is now based in Miami, and he plans to join them in early 2024.
""Historically, we've only had an office in New York, but during COVID we opened a small office in Miami and quickly realized it had very attractive benefits,"" Sen Sharma told Business Insider. ""One, the tax structure is more favorable for personal as well as from a corporate standpoint. And two, it's more affordable from a business perspective, and three, the cost of hiring employees is also less in terms of salaries.""
As it is, he said he spends a ""significant"" amount of time in Miami, even though he hasn't formally moved.
The executive noted that the company had some staffers come to the US from India, and Indxx initially stationed them in Miami because they happened to have more office space. The plan at the time was to eventually move them from Florida to New York, but the team enjoyed Miami so much that no one ended up relocating.
Census data shows recently Americans have been moving to Florida in droves, and an analysis from SmartAsset found that New Yorkers making $650,000 or more could save nearly $200,000 per year in tax and cost-of-living expenses by relocating to Miami.
To that point, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced in November he would move out of Seattle to Miami, where he could be poised to save millions in taxes.
A shifting finance hub
Sen Sharma maintained that New York City indeed has the upper hand in its status as the financial capital of the world. Yet he has still seen a number of businesses and clients mirror what Indxx has done in moving south.
""I'm seeing the opening and growing of offices in South Florida and on the east and west coast [of Florida],"" he said. ""I think based on everything I've seen, not only is that growth expected to continue, but it should be relatively permanent as well.""
New York has been deriving less and less tax revenue from Wall Street, and financial firms aren't adding to the ranks of workers in the Big Apple the way they used to. Instead, tech has accounted for a much larger share of New York City employment, growing steadily in the last decade, and picking up at a faster pace in the last three years.
""While [Wall Street] remains very important, its share of the city's economy has diminished, accounting for under 20% of wage and salary earnings in 2022,"" the New York City Comptroller's office said in a report on the city's employment trends published in October. ""Meanwhile, the tech industry has grown rapidly, both in terms of employment and income.""
For Sen Sharma, he says there is ""probably nothing"" that could convince him to stay in New York in 2024.
""We don't have office space in New York anymore, no long-term leases of any kind,"" he said. ""For a business like ours, nimble and agile, we go where it's easiest for us to do business. From a corporate tax perspective or an employee hiring and retention perspective, Florida seems to have more benefits these days than New York.""",finance.yahoo.com,A New York City finance CEO

(Reuters) - AMD estimated there was a $45 billion market for data center artificial intelligence processors this year as it launched a new generation of AI chips on Wednesday.
Advanced Micro Devices announced two new AI data center chips from its MI300 lineup: one focused on generative AI applications, and a second chip geared toward supercomputers. The version of the processor for generative AI, the MI300X, includes advanced high-bandwidth memory that improves performance.
As AMD launched the new processors, company executives outlined how rapidly demand for AI chips has increased. The company said it now expects the market for data center AI chips to grow to roughly $400 billion by 2027.
Analysts estimate that Nvidia has captured roughly 80% of the AI chip market, when including the custom processors built by companies such as Alphabet's Google and Microsoft. Nvidia does not break out its AI revenue, but a significant portion is captured in the company's data center segment. So far this year, Nvidia has reported data center revenue of $29.12 billion.
AMD's MI300 series launched on Wednesday is positioned to compete with Nvidia's flagship AI processors.
AMD also unveiled a new version of the software necessary to deploy the chips for AI.

Benchmark Brent rose toward $80 a barrel after capping the worst run of weekly declines in two years, while West Texas Intermediate neared $75. Investor expectations the Fed’s next move will be a cut has gathered strength this quarter, hurting the US dollar to make commodities more attractive.
Venezuelan supply was also in focus after the White House said it was evaluating possible consequences after President Nicolás Maduro missed an end-November deadline to release detained Americans. The US struck a deal with Venezuela in October to lift some sanctions, including on oil, and there’s concern the six-month transaction license may not be renewed.
Oil just capped a back-to-back monthly decline as supplies from non-OPEC countries including the US ballooned, while the outlook for demand growth softened. The retreat came despite a move last week by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to deepen production cuts.
In the Middle East, meanwhile, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed they targeted two Israeli ships in the Red Sea, part of a series of attacks against commercial vessels in international waters amid the war in Gaza. The US said one of its destroyers shot down three drones.

He has since become a vocal advocate for a cautious approach toward AI innovation.
Elon Musk had some choice parting words for OpenAI's staff before he left the company in 2018.
The billionaire cofounded the AI company in 2015 but left in 2018, citing a conflict of interest with his work at Tesla.
When Musk announced his departure to the company's employees, he told staff that OpenAI needed to hasten its progress, according to a Sunday report from The New York Times.
Musk's suggestion that OpenAI speed things up was met with pushback from an OpenAI research, The Times reported, citing three anonymous sources who say they were at the meeting. The researcher told Musk that Musk's suggestion was impulsive and overhasty, per The Times.
The billionaire left the meeting after calling the OpenAI researcher a ""jackass,"" The Times reported.
That Musk actually wanted OpenAI to move faster, not slower, is interesting in light of how he's styled himself as a vocal advocate for a cautious approach toward AI innovation.
In March, Musk signed an open letter that called for a six-month pause on AI development.
The letter, which was also signed by Steve Wozniak and Pinterest cofounder Evan Sharp, said that there was a need to step back ""from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities.""
""AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production,"" Musk told Fox News in April, adding that the technology ""has the potential of civilization destruction.""
Musk also announced his own AI startup, xAI in July. The company's website says it strives to ""accelerate human scientific discovery"" with AI technology.
And in November, Musk revealed xAI's Chat-GPT rival, Grok. Musk claimed in a post on his social media platform X that Grok had ""a massive advantage over other models"" because it had real-time access to X.

"['Dani Cook, The Motley Fool']",2023-12-19 12:34:42+00:00,,2023-12-19 12:00:00,"Based on earnings estimates, its share price could soar in the next two years.",https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2F2-reasons-buy-amazon-stock-120000856.html.json,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/3204272cd5b3db62fd4ae14c37fc278b,en,,"After suffering a 50% drop in its stock in 2022, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered an impressive turnaround this year.
Last year, high inflation and rising interest rates curbed consumer discretionary spending and caused significant declines in Amazon's e-commerce segments. However, in 2023, the company pulled its retail business back to profitability while delivering multiple quarters of impressive earnings.
As a result, Amazon's stock is up around 80% since Jan. 1. The company is on a promising growth trajectory with a recovering retail business and an expanding position in artificial intelligence (AI).
Now is an excellent time to learn more about this tech giant and potentially invest before it's too late. Here are two reasons to buy Amazon's stock like there's no tomorrow.
1. Amazon's comeback this year proves it's one of the most reliable investments over the long term
In 2022, Amazon's two e-commerce segments posted operating losses totaling $10.6 billion. The company managed to stay profitable thanks to its highly lucrative cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the steep declines made investors question whether Amazon's business would fully recover and if those vulnerabilities made it a risky investment.
The tech giant reacted quickly to poor macro conditions by introducing cost-cutting measures. Throughout 2022, it closed or canceled construction on dozens of warehouses, wound down unprofitable projects like Amazon Care, and laid off thousands of workers. The company has continued to prioritize profits this year, cutting thousands more jobs as recently as November, specifically in its music streaming, gaming, and Alexa divisions.
Amazon's restructuring has clearly paid off. In the third quarter of 2023, the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, operating income from its North American segment exceeded $4 billion, a marked improvement from the $412 million in losses it reported in the prior-year period.
Amazon's leadership proved its strength by quickly getting the company back on track after a challenging 2022. This year's stock price recovery illustrates why it's crucial for investors to take a long-term view and keep holding onto the shares of companies they believe in during market downturns. Those who sold Amazon's stock as it fell last year to cut their losses will not have benefited from its rebounding share price in 2023.
The company's solid management team has shown it can successfully navigate temporary headwinds, making its stock one you can confidently invest in over the long term.
2. Big gains projected over the next two years
E-commerce sales made up about 19% of all retail purchases worldwide in 2022, and that share is projected to hit 23% by 2027. Amazon dominates the industry in multiple countries. In the U.S. alone, it holds a 38% market share in online retail. In comparison, Walmart, which holds the second-largest share, is responsible for just 6%.
Amazon has significant earnings potential in the sector as consumers increasingly choose its site over brick-and-mortar stores.
Additionally, the company is making promising headway in AI through AWS. Grand View Research forecasts that the AI market will expand at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. Amazon is using AWS' leading market share in cloud computing to carve out a lucrative role in the industry.
This year, AWS has introduced a diverse range of new AI tools as it works to meet the growing demand for such services, and it also announced a venture into chip development.
Amazon is dominating two rapidly expanding markets, and its stock price is likely to reflect that growth well into the future. However, that doesn't mean it won't deliver big gains in the short term.
The chart above shows its earnings could exceed $4 per share by fiscal 2025. That figure multiplied by Amazon's current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 56 yields a stock price of $257. In other words, if the market continues to value Amazon in the same way as it does now, its shares could rise by 72% over the next two years.
With a recovering e-commerce business and solid position in AI, that amount of growth is not out of the question. As a result, Amazon stock is a screaming buy ahead of the new year and one you can confidently buy like there's no tomorrow.

Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), a global provider of database technology and enterprise resource planning software, reported its quarterly financial results on December 12, 2023, through the SEC 10-Q filing. The company, founded in 1977, has established itself as a leader in SQL-based relational database management systems. With a customer base spanning 175 countries and a workforce of 136,000 employees, Oracle's financial performance remains a critical indicator of its market position and strategic direction. The recent 10-Q filing reveals a year-over-year increase in cloud and license revenues, from $10,033 million to $10,817 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023. Total revenues for the same period rose from $12,275 million to $12,941 million, reflecting Oracle's continued growth trajectory. However, the hardware segment experienced a slight decline in revenues, indicating a shift in the company's revenue mix. The overall margin also improved, suggesting effective cost management and a strong competitive edge. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in Oracle's latest financial disclosures.
Strengths
Market Leadership and Revenue Growth: Oracle Corp's strength lies in its market leadership, particularly in the cloud and license segment. The recent financial data shows a significant year-over-year increase in revenues, from $10,033 million to $10,817 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023. This growth is a testament to Oracle's strong brand, innovative technology, and loyal customer base. The company's ability to generate a higher margin in this segment, as evidenced by the increase from $6,352 million to $6,915 million, highlights its operational efficiency and the value of its offerings in the competitive tech landscape.
Strategic Acquisitions and R&D Investments: Oracle's proactive approach to acquisitions, such as the strategic purchase of Cerner Corporation, has bolstered its product portfolio and expanded its reach in the healthcare IT sector. The company's commitment to investing in research and development is crucial for maintaining its competitive position and fostering innovation. Oracle's R&D efforts are not only essential for product enhancement but also for driving the development of new technologies that can open up additional revenue streams.
Weaknesses
Declining Hardware Revenues: A notable weakness in Oracle's portfolio is the declining hardware revenues, which dropped from $850 million to $756 million over the three-month period. This decline suggests a potential vulnerability in Oracle's hardware business and may reflect a broader industry shift towards cloud-based solutions. The company's hardware segment faces challenges in maintaining profitability and relevance as customer preferences evolve.
Dependency on Renewals: Oracle's financial stability is heavily reliant on the renewal of cloud services and license support contracts. While the company expects a high renewal rate, any significant change in customer renewal behavior could adversely affect Oracle's recurring revenue streams. This dependency underscores the need for Oracle to continuously innovate and provide value to ensure customer retention.
Opportunities
Cloud Services Expansion: The growing demand for cloud-based solutions presents a significant opportunity for Oracle. The company's cloud services and license support segment have shown resilience and growth potential, with the expectation that revenues will continue to increase. By capitalizing on this trend and expanding its cloud offerings, Oracle can further solidify its position in the market and attract new customers seeking modern IT solutions.
International Market Penetration: Oracle's global presence is a strategic advantage that offers opportunities for further expansion. With operations contributing a substantial portion of total revenues, Oracle can leverage its international footprint to tap into emerging markets and diversify its revenue sources. This geographical expansion can help mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations in any single region.
Threats
Competitive Pressures: Oracle operates in a highly competitive industry, facing threats from both established players and new entrants. The company must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share. Competitive pressures can lead to pricing challenges and increased marketing expenses, which could impact Oracle's profitability and market position.
Economic Fluctuations: Global economic uncertainties pose a threat to Oracle's business. Economic downturns can lead to reduced IT spending by customers, affecting Oracle's sales and profitability. Additionally, currency fluctuations can impact the company's international revenues and margins, necessitating effective financial risk management strategies.
In conclusion, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) exhibits strong market leadership and revenue growth, particularly in its cloud and license segment. Strategic acquisitions and investments in R&D are key strengths that position the company for future innovation. However, weaknesses such as declining hardware revenues and dependency on contract renewals need to be addressed. Opportunities for expansion in cloud services and international markets are promising, while competitive pressures and economic fluctuations remain significant threats. Oracle's forward-looking strategies, including a focus on cloud expansion and customer retention, will be crucial in navigating these challenges and capitalizing on growth opportunities.

Benchmarks declined in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul but rose in Tokyo and Sydney. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices slipped.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly “tankan” report, released Wednesday, measured business sentiment among major manufacturers at plus 12, up from plus 9 in October and plus 5 in June. It was the third straight month of improvement.
The survey measures corporate sentiment by subtracting the number of companies saying business conditions are negative from those replying they are positive.
“The continued improvement in the ‘tankan’ suggests that the drop in Q3 GDP was just a blip, but we still expect GDP growth to slow sharply next year,"" Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3% to 32,926.35 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.3% at 7,257.80.
Shares in China declined on what analysts said was disappointment over a lack of major stimulus measures from a major economic planning conference that ended on Tuesday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% to 16,231.97 and the Shanghai Composite index was down 1.2% at 2,968.76. South Korea's Kospi lost 1% to 2,510.66.
Taiwan's Taiex edged 0.1% higher and Bangkok's SET lost 1.1%.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to just below its all-time high set in early 2022 following a report showing inflation in the United States is behaving pretty much as expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%.
Big Tech stocks helped lead the way following solid gains for Nvidia, Meta Platforms and some other of Wall Street's largest and most influential stocks. They overshadowed a 12.4% tumble for Oracle, whose revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ forecasts.
Wall Street’s spotlight was on the inflation report, which showed U.S. consumers paid prices for gasoline, food and other living costs last month that were 3.1% higher overall than a year earlier. That was a slight deceleration from October’s 3.2% inflation and exactly in line with economists’ expectations.
The data likely changes nothing about what the Federal Reserve will do at its latest meeting on interest rates, which ends Wednesday. The widespread expectation is still for the Fed to keep its main interest rate steady.
The Fed has already yanked its main interest rate from virtually zero early last year to more than 5.25%, its highest level since 2001. It’s hoping to slow the economy and hurt investment prices by exactly the right amount: enough to stamp out high inflation but not so much that it causes a steep recession.
In other trading, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude gave up 43 cents to $68.18 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Tuesday, it lost $2.71 to settle at $68.61.
It had been above $93 in September but has been falling amid worries that global demand may fall short of available supplies.
Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 45 cents to $72.79 per barrel. It fell $2.79 on Tuesday to $73.24 per barrel.
The U.S. dollar rose to 145.87 Japanese yen from 145.45 yen.

Investors have raised their expectations for a coming Fed rate cut early next year.
US stocks ticked higher on Wednesday as investors took in the latest private payrolls data and remained optimistic about monetary easing from the Federal Reserve.
Companies added 103,000 jobs in November, according to ADP's latest employment report, lower than the 128,000 jobs expected and down from 113,000 in the prior month. Meanwhile, pay rose 5.6% year over year, the smallest gain since September 2021.
While the ADP data isn't always a good indicator of the Labor Department's report, which is due Friday, a cooling job market is good news for stocks.
Central bankers have cited an overly hot labor market a a reason why interest rates may need to stay higher-for-longer, but slower hiring and wage growth could push the Fed to trim interest rates next year. Markets are now pricing in a 62% chance the Fed could lower rates by March, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Users around the world watched The Night Agent for 812m hours, making the political thriller its most viewed show in the first half of this year.
The streaming giant has been criticised for not being transparent about how content performs on its platform.
The criticism was central to this year's Hollywood strikes, which paralysed the film and television industry for several months.
Actors and writers have been demanding higher royalties for shows that performed well on streaming platforms.
On a conference call with the media, co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged that the lack of transparency about the popularity of its shows had led to distrust in the creator community.
He added that Netflix had kept its viewer data private while it was building the business so it could experiment without giving away crucial information to potential competitors.
""This is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry,"" the company said in a blog post.
""We believe the viewing information in this report... will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them.""
Hollywood's creative community relies on viewing figures from audience data firm Nielsen - released annually - for traditional broadcast and cable television.
The What We Watched report ranks 18,000 titles by the amount of hours viewed between January and June this year. The company said it will now release the report every six months.
Covering nearly 100 billion hours of viewing time, other shows that featured prominently on the list included Ginny and Georgia, Gilmore Girls, Seinfeld, Friends and The Office.
The Mother starring Jennifer Lopez was the top movie, watched for more than 249 million hours.
Non-English content generated about a third of all viewing and Netflix said the data also shows there is still demand for older titles.
""Success on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone. We have enormously successful movies and TV shows with both lower and higher hours viewed. It's all about whether a movie or TV show thrilled its audience — and the size of that audience relative to the economics of the title,"" the company said.
With almost 250 million subscribers globally, Netflix is the largest streaming service in the world.
Since 2021, it has been releasing weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists, which show the most-watched movies and TV shows in English and other languages.
Netflix said that more than half of the titles released this year appeared on the weekly Top 10 lists.
The What We Watched report showed 55% of Netflix viewing came from original films and series and 45% from licensed titles, according to Mr Sarandos.
Last year, Netflix launched a separate service with adverts, which requires more transparency because advertisers want information about the popularity of content.",finance.yahoo.com,Netflix: Users spent 812m hours watching The Night Agent,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-users-spent-812m-hours-020324093.html,['NFLX'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 0, 'end': 7, 'score': 0.995746195316314}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'The Night Agent', 'normalized': 'The Night Agent', 'company_key': None, 'start': 108, 'end': 123, 'score': 0.9888374805450441}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'Hollywood', 'normalized': 'Hollywood', 'company_key': None, 'start': 374, 'end': 383, 'score': 0.998292624950408}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Ted Sarandos', 'normalized': 'Ted Sarandos', 'company_key': None, 'start': 628, 'end': 640, 'score': 0.994835615158081}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 778, 'end': 785, 'score': 0.9941304326057431}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 975, 'end': 982, 'score': 0.9929792284965511}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'Hollywood', 'normalized': 'Hollywood', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1192, 'end': 1201, 'score': 0.9991432428359981}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1360, 'end': 1362, 'score': 0.697112679481506}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'G', 'normalized': 'G', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1640, 'end': 1641, 'score': 0.45108675956726}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##inny', 'normalized': '##inny', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1641, 'end': 1645, 'score': 0.37515991926193204}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'Georgia', 'normalized': 'Georgia', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1650, 'end': 1657, 'score': 0.502307772636413}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Gilmore Girls', 'normalized': 'Gilmore Girls', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1659, 'end': 1672, 'score': 0.965228796005249}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Seinfeld', 'normalized': 'Seinfeld', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1674, 'end': 1682, 'score': 0.9297854304313661}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Friends', 'normalized': 'Friends', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1684, 'end': 1691, 'score': 0.8828498721122741}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'The Office', 'normalized': 'The Office', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1696, 'end': 1706, 'score': 0.9694248437881471}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'The Mother', 'normalized': 'The Mother', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1708, 'end': 1718, 'score': 0.937834501266479}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Jennifer Lopez', 'normalized': 'Jennifer Lopez', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1728, 'end': 1742, 'score': 0.9924339056015011}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Non', 'normalized': 'Non', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1803, 'end': 1806, 'score': 0.97560977935791}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'English', 'normalized': 'English', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1807, 'end': 1814, 'score': 0.9990492463111871}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 1866, 'end': 1873, 'score': 0.9919803142547601}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 1951, 'end': 1958, 'score': 0.975609898567199}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 2327, 'end': 2334, 'score': 0.9812829494476311}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'English', 'normalized': 'English', 'company_key': None, 'start': 2505, 'end': 2512, 'score': 0.9942435622215271}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Netflix', 'normalized': 'NFLX', 'company_key': 'NFLX', 'start': 2534, 'end': 2541, 'score': 0.9497455954551691}]","{'negative': 0.005294697824865, 'neutral': 0.01174138020724, 'positive': 0.9829639196395871}","{'neutral': 0.6069904565811151, 'anger': 0.24350957572460102, 'disgust': 0.08055854588747001, 'fear': 0.036933243274688006, 'joy': 0.012702927924692001, 'surprise': 0.010049374774098, 'sadness': 0.009255842305719}",2023/643c3d2fc5e859eb1425b83be0b2512a8424a1f1ae3057210e41311ecf0d54fe.json,12

View our latest analysis for Kopin
Because Kopin made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.
In the last three years, Kopin saw its revenue grow by 5.0% per year, compound. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. Indeed, the stock dropped 4% over the last three years. If revenue growth accelerates, we might see the share price bounce. But ultimately the key will be whether the company can become profitability.

A Different Perspective
Kopin provided a TSR of 6.8% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 2% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Kopin better, we need to consider many other factors.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese smartphone component supplier Murata Manufacturing aims to grow sales to Chinese makers of lower-end handsets destined for emerging markets as it looks beyond saturated strongholds.
Murata, a leading supplier of ceramic capacitors, sees the smartphone market growing 5% in the year ending March 2025, aided by demand for mid- and low-end handsets in places such as India, Africa and Southeast Asia.
""Exports by Chinese makers to areas with growing populations are really increasing,"" Murata President Norio Nakajima said in an interview.
Murata, a supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics, is among industry players grappling with depressed smartphone demand as consumers hold on to handsets for longer.
In October, smartphone sales grew 5% year-on-year after more than two years of decline, boosted by emerging-market demand, showed data from research firm Counterpoint.
Within China itself, excess inventory is normalising, Nakajima said.
Last month, Apple said demand for its iPhone in China remains strong, with analysts also pointing to strong sales of smartphones from local champion Huawei Technologies.
