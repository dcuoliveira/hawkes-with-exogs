Yet that figure is inconsistent with data on the nation’s March seaborne exports and supplies to domestic refineries — adding to the uncertainty over how much oil Russia actually pumps.
The Kremlin pledged to curb crude-only output by 500,000 barrels a day between March and December in retaliation for Western trade restrictions and a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven industrialized nations. The reduction was 40% higher, according to the Energy Ministry data.
Eight members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including de facto leader Saudi Arabia, agreed to join the voluntary cuts from May, bringing the total reductions to more than 1.6 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the global market.
The surprise decision drove an oil rally and set the stage for crude prices returning to $100 per barrel.
Russia will cut its crude-only output using February’s production as the baseline, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Bloomberg calculations based on industry data put that month’s production at 10.1 million barrels a day.
The Energy Ministry data say producers pumped a daily average of 1.285 million tons of crude, the person said, asking not to be identified because the figures aren’t public.
That’s equivalent to just over 9.4 million barrels, meaning crude-only cuts totaled nearly 700,000 barrels a day last month.
The nation’s total March production of crude oil and condensate averaged 1.413 million tons, the person said. That’s equivalent to 10.36 million barrels per day, compared with 11.1 million barrels in February, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The resulting total cuts averaged 740,000 barrels a day, the data indicate.
Russia classified its oil statistics last year due to their “sensitive” nature, making it difficult to assess the implementation of supply cuts beyond the assurances of energy officials.
As a result, Russia watchers have started following the nation’s seaborne oil exports and domestic oil-processing rates as gauges for crude production estimates. However, both indicators showed no visible declines last month.
The nation’s four-week average crude loadings through March 31 were at their highest since June, while Russian refineries kept their throughput roughly flat, according to Bloomberg figures based on the nation’s industry data and ship-tracking.
Russia’s Energy Ministry couldn’t immediately comment on the March production data and on what drove the pledged cuts.

TEMPE, Ariz., April 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- GoDaddy Inc. (NYSE: GDDY), the company that helps entrepreneurs thrive, just released a Small Business Generative AI Prompt Library (smallbusinessprompts.com), a catalog of more than 35 prompts, and growing, ready-made for small businesses to start benefiting from this innovative technology. Each prompt, which is a description of the request you want generative AI to accomplish for you, is specifically designed to help small businesses get helpful results out of tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.
""Generative AI levels the playing field for small businesses by giving them an incredible amount of power and knowledge, normally reserved for large corporations, right at their fingertips,"" said Geoff Clawson, VP of Product, Websites + Marketing. ""That's why GoDaddy created the Small Business Generative AI Prompt Library. It gives small businesses the ability to accomplish a variety of tasks quickly and easily. We've taken the mystery out of writing effective prompts for small businesses.""
The prompts help tackle some of the most common issues small business owners encounter when starting or running their ventures. From marketing idea generation to suggesting responses to customer reviews, business owners can accomplish in minutes what previously could have taken hours or days.
Some of the prompts in GoDaddy's Small Business Generative AI Prompt Library include:
Ask me 2-5 questions to understand my business and then recommend a growth strategy from the perspective of a world-renowned growth hacker. Prioritize unique, low-cost strategies.
Act as a marketing copywriter and ask me for an existing product description to rewrite. Then rewrite the product description so it's more effective at converting prospects into customers.
Act as a marketing expert for SMBs. Be succinct and prioritize content that drives sales. Build a content calendar for the next 6 months with topics for a business that account for relevant holidays. I want the calendar to be monthly.
Act as a social media expert. Coach me on responding to a customer who left a negative review. Help me be empathetic, let the customer know we hear their issue and that we'll try to fix the problem. The customer had complaints about .
Why should a small business owner turn to GoDaddy's Small Business Generative AI Prompt Library for advice? To answer that question, GoDaddy asked ChatGPT. Here's what it told us.
""Small businesses have always faced challenges when it comes to creating high-quality content efficiently and on a tight budget,"" said ChatGPT, an AI Language Model. ""As a language model powered by generative AI, I can attest to the tremendous potential of this technology to address these challenges. The launch of this new prompt library for generative AI is a game-changer for small businesses, as it provides them with a powerful tool to generate high-quality content quickly and easily. With the ability to streamline their content creation process, small businesses can focus on what they do best - delivering exceptional products and services to their customers. This new library is an exciting development that will undoubtedly help small businesses thrive in today's competitive marketplace.""
This is just the beginning of this new library - GoDaddy will add new prompts to the library throughout 2023. The company is working on developing many new ways for small businesses to harness generative AI, and has already added smart features into products, like adding relevant slogans to videos and recommending marketing calendars based on the customer's location and business. And this is just the beginning, there are more features on the way.

Selbyville, Delaware, April 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
The supply chain security market valuation is anticipated to cross USD 4 billion by 2032, as reported in a research study by Global Market Insights Inc.
The rising adoption of omnichannel retail approaches and online shopping following the COVID-19 pandemic are key factors driving supply chain security software development. Based on the 2020 Census Bureau’s Annual Retail Trade Survey, in 2020, e-commerce sales surged by 43% or USD 244.2 billion. This trend showcases the rapid rise in requirements for real-time tracking and visibility of supply chains to prevent theft, counterfeiting, and other frauds. As a result, supply chain security frameworks will gain traction as a solution to provide end-to-end control of goods from warehouses to consumers.

Supply chain security market from the service component segment is projected to witness over 10% CAGR till 2032, due to the role of integration and deployment services in limiting business operation inefficiencies. Since professional service providers manage all aspects of supply chain security, customers can focus on core businesses. Training and consulting services are also being designed to help organizations address risks and train on regulatory compliance and emerging vulnerabilities. The acceleration of supply chain cyber-attacks will therefore fuel the industry demand.
The supply chain security market from the healthcare segment is estimated hit USD 700 million by 2032, on account of supply chain automation and smart device penetration. Supply inventory automation can provide healthcare companies with more understanding of the budget and help them reduce waste through the elimination of over-ordering of perishable goods. The growing awareness of the role of supply chain security policy in improving patient safety, complying with regulatory guidelines, and safeguarding against cyber threats will also boost service demand for healthcare applications.
Europe supply chain security market will register more than 20% share by 2032, as a result of rapid digitalization and supply chain business expansion. Citing an instance, in November 2022, Inxeption, a B2B supply chain digitalization platform, launched its operations in Germany to increase its reach to customers in Europe. However, weak consumer demand has fueled a wave of retail store closures, especially in the UK. These factors may create roadblocks to the market expansion in the region.

The IRS issues a Failure to Pay Penalty of just 0.5% on any portion of your bill that’s still outstanding after the April 18 filing deadline. But, if you don’t submit a return on time, the agency will slap you with a Failure to File penalty of 5%.
Considering that it’s 10 times more expensive to file late than to pay late, it’s no surprise that a new GOBankingRates survey found that missing the deadline is the chief concern for more than 13% of the population.
You still have more than a month and a half to submit your returns, which probably feels like a long time. But making the deadline is all about controlling the clock, which you can do only if you avoid surprises.
Follow these steps to complete your taxes before the buzzer sounds.
First, Get Organized
Start by establishing a place to set aside all of your relevant documents and forms so you can tuck them away as soon as they arrive. This way, you’re not scrambling to find missing paperwork as the Tax Day deadline draws near.
Create a folder in Dropbox, Google Drive or — if you’re going old school — in a drawer or filing cabinet in your house. Then, take inventory of what you’ll need for your folder and what you already have.
“If you want to make sure you file your taxes on time, make a quick list of the documents you need,” said Chris Alman, CFP, CEPA and founder and lead advisor of Equip Financial Partners. “This might include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, charitable receipts, taxes paid, etc. Once you have what you need, you’ll know you’re ready to file. If you’re still waiting for a form, you’ll know to check with the entity providing the form and whether or not you need to file an extension.”
Take Our Poll: What Do You Plan To Use Your Tax Refund For?
Research and Plan Ahead
While you’re waiting for your documents, brush up on the many changes that took place in 2022 — the first tax year after the pandemic stimulus era — and clarify which credits were eliminated, reduced or, in some cases, expanded.
Learn about the tax implications that are unique to your situation. If you’re a sole proprietor, for example, you can avoid expensive and time-consuming surprises by understanding the self-employment tax.
Make decisions that don’t require you to have all of your documents, like choosing your filing status and whether you’ll itemize or take the standard deduction. If you’re itemizing, gather your receipts and other supporting documents you’ll need in order to avoid or survive an audit.
Industry heavyweights such as TurboTax offer comprehensive checklists of things to do before it’s time to file so you’ll be ready to pounce once your folder is complete. Also, the IRS reminds taxpayers to create or check in with their accounts at IRS.gov to help things go as smoothly and quickly as possible.
Explore Your Software Options in Advance
The largest percentage of the GOBankingRates survey’s respondents, about 44%, plan to file their taxes with the help of a software provider such as TurboTax or H&R Block — but those are hardly the only options. There’s also TaxAct, TaxSlayer, Jackson-Hewitt Online, Cash App Taxes, FreeTaxUSA, Liberty Tax and more.
Some are best for filers on a budget or the self-employed. Others excel at reporting cryptocurrency holdings and other digital assets. Others are known for excellent customer service, reliable audit assistance or simply for being easy to use.
A lot of companies are competing for your business. Get to know them and their different pricing tiers, decide what you value in a software program and ensure you’re trusting your taxes to the right one when the time comes.
Enlist Help While You Still Have the Chance
Another 25% of survey respondents plan to file through the services of a CPA or tax attorney — and that can be money well spent.
“Tax filing can be overwhelming for some people, and hiring a CPA makes the job easier for you,” said Riva Jeane May Caburog, of the Nadrich & Cohen law firm. “An experienced accountant can help compute your taxes, file the form on your behalf and back you up when the IRS conducts a tax audit.”
The key to filing on time is to secure the services of your chosen tax professional well in advance.
March signals peak tax season when tax professionals earn most of their living for the year. The experts with the most extensive client lists might already be booked solid, but plenty of good ones still have openings. It’s crucial to contact a few and lock in the services of one you like now. If you wait until mid-April under the assumption that tax pros will be available and eager for your business, it’s a sure way to file late and incur the wrath of the IRS.

But since the financial services industry is ever-evolving, even boomers need to take note of the ongoing changes. Keeping up-to-date with the latest market conditions, technological advances and investment opportunities is essential to optimizing a long-term portfolio, so boomers in particular need to continue learning money skills. Here are some of the most important.
Using Technology To Help With Your Finances
Technological advances in the financial world come fast these days. Whereas boomers may have started out their investment lives having to call their full-service broker to make trades and indeed even to get any information about the markets, those days have passed. Now, countless budgeting, savings and investment apps — many of which are free — can help investors plan their portfolios, make trades, perform market research and manage their entire financial lives right from the palm of their hands.
While many boomers may still be more comfortable with calling their financial advisors or visiting them in person, for countless others, this added convenience and access to information can transform their financial lives. Boomers should continue to learn about how technology is changing the landscape and how some of these tools can help them with their own personal finances.
Budgeting for New Types of Expenses
Technology has helped change much more than the financial world over the past few decades. The world as a whole has become much more interconnected, and modern conveniences have transformed everything from driving a car to watching entertainment at home. And while many of these advances have made life much more convenient, they also typically come with new costs.

While it’s great to be able to click on Netflix or Hulu and choose from thousands of movies or TV shows to watch, you’ll also have to budget for a monthly subscription. If you’re a music lover, services like Amazon Unlimited allow you to choose from nearly any song that was ever published — but again, you’ll have to pay a monthly or annual fee. In this technologically advanced era, it’s important, particularly for boomers, to learn about how these services work, how to budget for them and how to decide if they are worth the cost.
Picking the Right Social Security Strategy
Although Social Security may seem like an automatic retirement benefit, the truth is that you can only get the most out of it by reviewing your claiming strategy regularly. There is no single “right” Social Security strategy, and a number of factors — factors that can change throughout your life — will affect what will ultimately work best for you.
For example, you may be eager to claim Social Security as early as possible, at age 62, but you may find as you age that you have a significant nest egg already built up in your retirement accounts. In this case, it may make sense to wait to file until age 67 or even age 70 in order to boost your monthly paychecks. Similarly, if you start earning more late in life, your benefit will naturally increase, which might require a recalculation as to when you should start taking Social Security. Either way, these are decisions best made in conjunction with a financial advisor.
Handling Inflation
It has been decades since inflation has been a serious threat, but that all changed in 2021 and 2022. Inflation hit a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, the highest rate in over 40 years. Most boomers haven’t likely factored in how much high inflation can erode purchasing power, and the longer it lasts, the more damage it can do to the real value of your retirement portfolio. In other words, if you’ve maintained the same dollar target for your nest egg over your entire investing career, you might have to boost that figure to keep the standard of living you envision in retirement.
Managing Property Gains
If you bought your property more than two years ago, you’re likely sitting on a large profit. For many homeowners, this may be a new experience. While some may have seen their home price go steadily upwards, in 2020 and 2021 prices shot up dramatically, over a relatively short period of time. Even if you planned to hold your house for the rest of your life, the large profit you may have now gives you additional options, and it pays to learn what those are.
One option is to simply pocket that huge gain and put it right into your savings or investments. But if you go that route, you’ll have to factor in potential taxes — and the fact that moving to a new home may very well be more expensive. Between skyrocketing home prices and rising mortgage rates, even downsizing into a smaller house will likely result in a higher monthly mortgage price.
There are other options for tapping your home equity, such as home equity loans or HELOCs, but you’ll have to brush up on how those operate before you consider them. Keeping in constant touch with a financial and/or tax advisor regarding these types of real estate strategies can help prepare you for the time when you’re ready to make a move, if ever.

The company said on Monday it was beginning to restore its services which prevented most of its 61,000 staff from being able to work on Friday as they were unable to log into its systems.
Capita said in a statement to investors that there was “no evidence of customer, supplier or colleague data having been compromised”.
It added: “Our IT security monitoring capabilities swiftly alerted us to the incident, and we quickly invoked our established and practised technical crisis management protocols.”
Capita said it is restoring access to its Microsoft Office 365 services, used to provide business-critical programmes to staff such as spreadsheets, email and word processing software.
Capita runs outsourced IT services for substantial parts of the NHS, including many NHS Trusts that oversee hospitals as well as some local GP surgeries.
It also holds a £456m contract to collect and enforce the BBC TV licence fee, runs military recruiting processes for the Ministry of Defence.
On Friday its staff reported seeing correct passwords rejected by Capita’s IT systems when they tried to log in.
Text messages were also sent by Capita to its employees warning them not to try logging in with security-enhancing virtual private networks (VPNs) or to attempt to change their passwords.
The Cabinet Office, which works closely with Capita because of the number of public sector contracts Capita holds, has been contacted for comment.
Microsoft did not comment on Capita’s suggestions that its cloud-based Office 365 service was to blame for the widespread outage.
The public Office 365 status page on Microsoft’s website, showing whether the IT service has gone offline or suffered a drop in service, has shown no sign of any problems.
Office 365 can be installed on a company’s own computer servers instead of running from Microsoft’s cloud service.
One area of potential weakness in Microsoft Windows-based computer networks is the Active Directory user account folder, which holds details of every user account on that network.
A botched IT upgrade or a deliberate cyberattack can corrupt or delete that folder, leaving users unable to log in or change their passwords.",finance.yahoo.com,BBC licence fee collector Capita confirms cyber attack,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bbc-licence-fee-collector-capita-090311685.html,['MSFT'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 6, 'score': 0.9963111877441401}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'NHS', 'normalized': 'NHS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 78, 'end': 81, 'score': 0.9953343272209161}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'BBC', 'normalized': 'BBC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 86, 'end': 89, 'score': 0.9985472559928891}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 367, 'end': 373, 'score': 0.9950368404388421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 681, 'end': 687, 'score': 0.9839925765991211}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Microsoft Office 365', 'normalized': 'Microsoft Office 365', 'company_key': None, 'start': 723, 'end': 743, 'score': 0.99578857421875}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 866, 'end': 872, 'score': 0.991368293762207}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'IT', 'normalized': 'IT', 'company_key': None, 'start': 889, 'end': 891, 'score': 0.48878127336502003}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'NHS', 'normalized': 'NHS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 930, 'end': 933, 'score': 0.989384591579437}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'NHS Trust', 'normalized': 'NHS Trust', 'company_key': None, 'start': 950, 'end': 959, 'score': 0.9209511280059811}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'GP', 'normalized': 'GP', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1006, 'end': 1008, 'score': 0.8898214101791381}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'BBC TV', 'normalized': 'BBC TV', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1078, 'end': 1084, 'score': 0.9776530265808101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Ministry of Defence', 'normalized': 'Ministry of Defence', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1141, 'end': 1160, 'score': 0.9984664916992181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1228, 'end': 1234, 'score': 0.9858071804046631}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1307, 'end': 1313, 'score': 0.98542320728302}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Cabinet Office', 'normalized': 'Cabinet Office', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1467, 'end': 1481, 'score': 0.9987572431564331}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1508, 'end': 1514, 'score': 0.9908944368362421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1564, 'end': 1570, 'score': 0.9938669800758361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Microsoft', 'normalized': 'MSFT', 'company_key': 'MSFT', 'start': 1610, 'end': 1619, 'score': 0.99861741065979}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Capita', 'normalized': 'Capita', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1639, 'end': 1645, 'score': 0.9921820163726801}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Office 365', 'normalized': 'Office 365', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1681, 'end': 1691, 'score': 0.9939165115356441}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Office 365', 'normalized': 'Office 365', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1751, 'end': 1761, 'score': 0.977135419845581}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Microsoft', 'normalized': 'MSFT', 'company_key': 'MSFT', 'start': 1777, 'end': 1786, 'score': 0.9977002739906311}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Office', 'normalized': 'Office', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1912, 'end': 1918, 'score': 0.9309774041175841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Microsoft', 'normalized': 'MSFT', 'company_key': 'MSFT', 'start': 2000, 'end': 2009, 'score': 0.983869135379791}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Microsoft', 'normalized': 'MSFT', 'company_key': 'MSFT', 'start': 2061, 'end': 2070, 'score': 0.993204474449157}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Windows', 'normalized': 'Windows', 'company_key': None, 'start': 2071, 'end': 2078, 'score': 0.675860941410064}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'IT', 'normalized': 'IT', 'company_key': None, 'start': 2217, 'end': 2219, 'score': 0.810083031654357}]","{'negative': 0.9351229071617121, 'neutral': 0.060401830822229004, 'positive': 0.0044753011316060005}","{'neutral': 0.484280318021774, 'sadness': 0.22046206891536702, 'fear': 0.19549088180065102, 'anger': 0.046181008219718, 'disgust': 0.027192808687686, 'surprise': 0.020739085972309, 'joy': 0.005653789266943}",2023/74e66cad65f0bbb23da322550fcd75c8986151f6bab591a6e72930bbde82e41f.json,4
