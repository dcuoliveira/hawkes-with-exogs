The Telegraph and Forbes report that UK health tech firm Rockley Photonics recently confirmed in an SEC filing that Apple has been its largest customer for the past two years, and that it has a continuing deal to develop future products. Rockley's focus has been on sensors that track blood glucose, pressure and even alcohol levels, suggesting that at least one of these features will be available in a future Apple Watch.
Apple's support for diabetics has so far been limited to carrying third-party monitors in its stores.
There's no guarantee the Rockley deal will lead to shipping products. Apple hasn't been shy about focusing the Apple Watch on health, however, and there's plenty of industry interest in developing wearable blood sugar sensors that don't require needles. If Apple can build the technology into a mainstream product like the Watch, it could offer an advantage to anyone tired of jabbing themselves to keep their diabetes in check.
Rockley's other technologies could help, too. Blood pressure tracking could alert you to issues like stress, and alcohol monitoring might keep your drinking in moderation. Whether or not that's feasible is another matter. Apple still has to consider factors like battery life and price, and it's entirely possible that you could be waiting a while for all these features (assuming they ever ship) even if the tech is otherwise ready.",finance.yahoo.com,Apple Watch could get blood sugar monitoring thanks to a UK tech deal,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-watch-blood-sugar-rockley-photonics-212241562.html,['AAPL'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple Watch', 'normalized': 'Apple Watch', 'company_key': None, 'start': 30, 'end': 41, 'score': 0.9297623634338371}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Telegraph and Forbes', 'normalized': 'Telegraph and Forbes', 'company_key': None, 'start': 104, 'end': 124, 'score': 0.859685182571411}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'UK', 'normalized': 'UK', 'company_key': None, 'start': 137, 'end': 139, 'score': 0.963991522789001}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Rockley Photonics', 'normalized': 'Rockley Photonics', 'company_key': None, 'start': 157, 'end': 174, 'score': 0.998731255531311}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'SEC', 'normalized': 'SEC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 200, 'end': 203, 'score': 0.995721220970153}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 216, 'end': 221, 'score': 0.9988232254981991}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Rockley', 'normalized': 'Rockley', 'company_key': None, 'start': 338, 'end': 345, 'score': 0.9741985797882081}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple Watch', 'normalized': 'Apple Watch', 'company_key': None, 'start': 511, 'end': 522, 'score': 0.7838091850280761}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 524, 'end': 529, 'score': 0.9990517497062681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Rockley', 'normalized': 'Rockley', 'company_key': None, 'start': 651, 'end': 658, 'score': 0.654981553554534}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 696, 'end': 701, 'score': 0.9989901185035701}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 737, 'end': 742, 'score': 0.785424888134002}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Watch', 'normalized': 'Watch', 'company_key': None, 'start': 743, 'end': 748, 'score': 0.5942890048027031}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 883, 'end': 888, 'score': 0.9983356595039361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Watch', 'normalized': 'Watch', 'company_key': None, 'start': 949, 'end': 954, 'score': 0.5602836608886711}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Rockley', 'normalized': 'Rockley', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1055, 'end': 1062, 'score': 0.94279009103775}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1282, 'score': 0.9988075494766231}]","{'negative': 0.000175810157088, 'neutral': 0.00046107752132200006, 'positive': 0.9993631243705751}","{'neutral': 0.906628787517547, 'joy': 0.051905483007431, 'surprise': 0.026733370497822, 'anger': 0.005532005801796001, 'fear': 0.0034136511385440002, 'sadness': 0.00312571413815, 'disgust': 0.002661026082932}",2021/fdc6ab6b3ac09bf018781b0ee031d4d15f997707d769352fa601c047fb061037.json,5
['Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP'],2021-05-02 15:26:02+00:00,,2021-05-02 14:15:00,"RADNOR, Pa., May 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a securities fraud class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE: EBS) (“Emergent”) on behalf of those who purchased or acquired Emergent common stock between July 6, 2020 and March 31, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Deadline Reminder: Investors who purchased or acquired Emergent common stock during the Class Period may, no later than June 18, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP: James Maro, Esq. (484) 270-1453 or Adrienne Bell, Esq. (484) 270-1435; toll free at (844) 887-9500; via e-mail at info@ktmc.com; or click https://www.ktmc.com/emergent-biosolutions-class-action-lawsuit?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=emergent Emergent is a specialty biopharmaceutical company that develops vaccines and antibody therapeutics for infectious diseases. The Class Period commences on July 6, 2020, when Emergent issued a press release announcing that it had signed a five-year agreement for large-scale drug substance manufacturing for Johnson & Johnson’s (“J&J”) lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Under the agreement, valued at $480 million for the first two years, Emergent would begin manufacturing J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 at Emergent’s manufacturing facility in Baltimore. In announcing the agreement, Emergent’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert G. Kramer Sr., highlighted Emergent’s “manufacturing strength to address the COVID-19 pandemic.” Emergent’s Senior Vice President, Syed T. Husain, added that Emergent had “the expertise and capabilities to meet the long-term needs of [its] customers and provide ongoing commercial manufacturing to benefit patients.” Shortly thereafter, on July 27, 2020, Emergent issued a press release announcing another deal with AstraZeneca to provide services to support production of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. This deal, valued at approximately $174 million, also contracted Emergent to produce drug substance manufacturing services at its Baltimore facility, beginning in 2020, at a large scale for commercial supply. The truth about Emergent was revealed on March 31, 2021 after the close of markets, when The New York Times published an article reporting on the accidental contamination of COVID-19 vaccines developed by J&J and AstraZeneca at the Emergent manufacturing plant in Baltimore. The New York Times article stated that in late February 2021, employees at Emergent’s Baltimore manufacturing plant inconceivably “mixed up” ingredients of the two different COVID-19 vaccines, contaminating up to 15 million doses of J&J’s vaccine and forcing regulators to delay authorization of the plant’s production lines. Further, The New York Times article noted that Emergent’s massive vaccine lot contamination went undiscovered for days until J&J’s quality control checks uncovered it, raising questions about Emergent’s failed training and supervision of its employees during the production process. Following this news, Emergent’s stock price dropped from a close of $92.91 on March 31, 2021, down to a close of $80.46 on April 1, 2021, a drop of over 13%. As more facts unfolded in the media, Emergent’s stock price continued to decline, closing at $78.62 on April 5, 2021. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose that: (i) Emergent’s Baltimore plant had a history of manufacturing issues increasing the likelihood for massive contaminations; (ii) these longstanding contamination risks and quality control issues at Emergent’s facility led to a string of U.S. Food and Drug Administration citations; (iii) Emergent previously had to discard the equivalent of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines after workers at the Baltimore plant deviated from manufacturing standards; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants’ public statements about Emergent’s ability and capacity to mass manufacture multiple COVID-19 vaccines at its Baltimore manufacturing site were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. Emergent investors may, no later than June 18, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

American Federation of Teachers Union Influenced CDC on In-Person-Learning Guidelines
The American Federation of Teachers influenced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s February guidelines on reopening schools, according to emails reported by the New York Post on Saturday. At least two language suggestions made by the AFT were adopted in some form in the final text of the CDC’s guidelines, the Post found. The emails were provided to the paper by Americans for Public Trust, a conservative watchdog group that obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request. While the CDC was preparing to declare that all schools could provide in-person learning regardless of the degree of community spread of coronavirus, AFT senior director for health issues Kelly Trautner proposed adding new language. “In the event of high community-transmission results from a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a new update of these guidelines may be necessary,” Trautner’s suggestion read. The language was added as part of the CDC’s guidance on reopening. The AFT also pushed for exemptions from in-person work for teachers and staff at higher risk of susceptibility to coronavirus, as well as staff with a family member at high risk for COVID-19. Language outlining these exemptions was adopted as part of the final CDC guidance. “Thank you again for Friday’s rich discussion about forthcoming CDC guidance and for your openness to the suggestions made by our president, Randi Weingarten, and the AFT,” Trautner wrote in a February 1 email. “We were able to review a copy of the draft guidance document over the weekend and were able to provide some initial feedback to several staff this morning about possible ways to strengthen the document.” That email was forwarded to CDC director Dr. Rachel Walensky by White House coronavirus testing coordinator Carol Johnson. The CDC and AFT said discussions between the two agencies are routine, in comments to the Post. “Naturally, we have been in regular touch with the agencies setting policy that affect [school employees’] work and lives, including the CDC,” AFT spokeswoman Oriana Korin said, noting that the union held similar conversations with the Trump administration. The Biden administration initially struggled to reopen schools for full in-person learning before the summer vacation. Reopening has faced significant pushback from some teachers unions, with the head of the Los Angeles teachers union alleging in March that California’s reopening plan propagated “structural racism,” while in Chicago a reopening agreement was reached in February after months of failed negotiations between the city and teachers union. As of May 2, 4 percent of U.S. school districts are holding all-remote classes, with 47 percent holding full in-person learning. Meanwhile, 48 percent of districts are operating a hybrid schedule of in-person and remote learning, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s Return to Learn Tracker.

Fed’s Kaplan Wants to Talk Taper, Breaks Ranks With Powell
(Bloomberg) -- Discover what’s driving the global economy and what it means for policy makers, businesses, investors and you with The New Economy Daily. Sign up hereSigns of excess risk taking in financial markets show it’s time for the U.S. central bank to start debating a reduction in its massive bond purchases, said the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, breaking ranks with Chair Jerome Powell.“We’re now at a point where I’m observing excesses and imbalances in financial markets,” said Robert Kaplan during a virtual event Friday. “I’m very attentive to that, and that’s why I do think at the earliest opportunity I think will be appropriate for us to start talking about adjusting those purchases.”Kaplan is not a voter this year on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The Dallas Fed chief has been one of the Fed’s more hawkish officials and has said that he projects the central bank will raise interest rates next year. The median estimate of the 18 policy makers is that rates will stay near zero through 2023.His remarks contradict Powell, who told reporters Wednesday that the “time is not yet” to talk about tapering the Fed’s $120 billion monthly pace of bond buying.”It’s not surprising that Kaplan is making a case now for tapering because he’s already been making the case,” said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG. “The surprising thing is that it’s so soon right after Chair Powell had been very explicit in saying now is not the time to talk about tapering. That’s the dichotomy there.”Powell spoke after the FOMC unanimously voted to hold interest rates near zero and repeated it would maintain the pace of bond buying until “substantial further progress” had been made on its goals for employment and inflation.Kaplan, the first official to speak publicly snce the post-FOMC blackout period ended, said that threshold was approaching faster than anticipated as the U.S. economy recovers from the pandemic.“I think we’re going to reach that benchmark sooner than I would have expected in January and others would have expected,” he said. “I think the U.S. economy will be far healthier when we have the ability to start weaning off those purchases.”A stock market at record highs, tight credit spreads and private investors driving up housing prices all point to imbalances in financial markets, Kaplan said. He’s paying particular attention to investors buying up single-family properties, often using all-cash offers to outbid families looking to purchase their first home.“We’ve got real excesses in the housing market,” Kaplan said. “It’s not yet the speculative situation that we had back in ‘07, ‘08 and ‘09, but I think it bears watching and keeping a close eye on.”(Updates with more details starting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger Says Bitcoin Is 'Disgusting And Contrary To Interests Of Civilization'
The inevitable question came up about Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) during today's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) 2021 shareholders meeting with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Buffett Dodges: Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said he hates it when he sees politicians dodge questions, but that he would do so himself on the question of Bitcoin. ""We had a governor one time in Nebraska, a long time ago, and he would get a tough question, you know. 'What do you think about property taxes?' or 'What should we do about schools?' and he'd look right at the person, and he'd say, 'I'm all right on that one!' and he'd walk off. Well, I'm all right on that one,"" Buffett said before turning it over to Vice Chairman Munger. See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin Munger Weighs In: ""Those who know me well are just waving the red flag to the bull,"" Munger said. ""Of course, I hate the Bitcoin success. I don't welcome a currency that's so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth. Nor do I like just shuffling out a few extra billions and billions and billions of dollars to someone who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damned development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization, and I'll leave the criticism to others."" To which Buffett responded, ""I'm all right on that one!"" Earlier in February, Munger had said that trading cryptocurrencies is ""just dementia"" and that the price of Bitcoin was far too volatile to be a mainstream medium of exchange. ""It's really kind of an artificial substitute for gold, and since I never buy any gold, I never buy any Bitcoin. I recommend that other people follow my practice,"" he said. Bitcoin reached a new record high of over $63,000 on April 13. Price Action: Bitcoin is up 96.62% year-to-date. Bitcoin is up slightly by 1.76% in the last 24 hours at $57,776.

Is Dogecoin Dead? Elon Musk and Mark Cuban Say ‘So Much No’
When Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) enthusiasts created #DogeDay, many hoped that Dogecoin prices would go to $1. Even fifty cents would have been acceptable. Source: Shutterstock Instead, Apr. 20 marked one of Dogecoin’s worst days on record. Within hours, the coin had dropped from its open of around 40 cents to a close of 32 cents. By the end of the week, the “meme coin” had sunk below 20 cents, wiping out $25 billion of investor wealth. “There was anxiety with larger investors who had big positions that the dog had its day coming and wanted to exit,” said Eric Schiffer, the head of a private equity firm called The Patriarch Organization.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For all purposes, it looked like Dogecoin was dead. But momentum bulls would have the last laugh. As celebrities like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk began tweeting about the cryptocurrency, investors began to buy back in. Almost magically, Dogecoin prices started to rise again. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Now, as investors try to make sense of an asset with “zero intrinsic value,” momentum investors will continue to confound traditional ones. As this week has shown, Dogecoin might be dead — but just not quite yet. Dogecoin Prices: The World’s $40 Billion Prank Cryptocurrency’s biggest inside joke has long confused conventional investors. All coins already have zero intrinsic value and Dogecoin made a point to satirize that fact. Its original 2013 code awarded up to one billion coins per solved block, making DOGE virtually unusable as a form of currency. Fast forward to 2021, however, and DOGE has emerged as one of the most serious money-makers of the year. $10,000 invested in Dogecoin at the start of the year would have turned to over $870,000 at its peak. Ordinary retail investors became overnight millionaires. Technologically, Dogecoin has also grown up. Its once ludicrous mining reward system now runs on a system that mimics a 2.5% inflation rate. A “merged mining” ability also allows miners to process DOGE in parallel with Litecoin (CCC:LTE-USD), significantly increasing its mining pool. Yet, Dogecoin prices seem to have a life of their own. Its major technological overhauls in 2014 coincided with a huge collapse in value. Three years later, the opposite was true; though development virtually ceased in Q1 2017, Dogecoin prices would rise 3700% by the end of that year. The explanation for these movements varies, from a failed Reddit investment scheme to a broader cryptocurrency mania. Recently, DOGE price movements have become stranger still. On Jan. 28, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted the first of many posts referencing Dogecoin — a photoshopped issue of “Dogue” magazine with Cinza the Whippet on the cover. DOGE prices jumped 500% by the next day, creating a pattern of price rises following any mention by the new Tweeter-in-Chief. Source: Thompson Reuters Dogecoin prices after Elon Musk tweet Other celebrities have since jumped on board. In February, billionaire Mark Cuban told Forbes that he had bought Dogecoin for his son. “It’s fun, it’s exciting and educational for him,” Cuban said during the interview. “It gives you a better chance of winning than a lottery ticket.” That educational lesson might have earned investors billions. By mid-April, Dogecoin’s prices rose so high that it briefly replaced XRP (CCC:XRP-USD) as the world’s fourth-largest currency. The Driving Forces of Dogecoin When cryptocurrencies took off in the early 2010s, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) dominated. Creating new wallets was a cumbersome process and few investors ventured beyond what they already knew. As such, Bitcoin held at least 95% market dominance through 2016. As high-quality exchanges started appearing, however, Bitcoin’s early lead became less critical. Newer exchanges allowed customers to buy dozens of different coins without creating a new wallet for each currency. The technological barriers to new altcoins started to crumble. In its place, the power of celebrity started taking over. Coins like Cardano (CCC:ADA-USD), Polkadot (CCC:DOT-USD) and Stellar (CCC:XLM-USD) soon climbed the crypto ranks thanks to their all-star development teams. In some cases, technology didn’t even seem to matter. In March, Tron (CCC:TRON-USD) CEO Justin Sun made headlines after losing a high-profile $69 million auction for the most expensive NFT (non-fungible token) artwork to date. The currency of the well-known “hype man of the century” would go on to nearly quadruple by mid-April, despite Tron’s severe plagiarism issues (Sun would go on to blame this on bad “translation”). Today, these same celebrity forces are now driving Dogecoin prices higher. It doesn’t seem to matter that Dogecoin has virtually no development team, nor that its technology is practically identical to Litecoin’s. As more high-profile names jump on board, the cryptocurrency’s price only seems to go in one direction: up. Momentum Becomes the Driving Force Dogecoin’s “celebrity effect” has also coincided with a broader shift towards momentum investing — a byproduct of social media’s role in promoting cryptocurrencies. Many coins now have dedicated fan bases who unwittingly create feedback loops in a coin’s price. Rising prices draw more social-media interest, which causes more buyers to join and so on. The results have been nothing short of breathtaking. An investor who bought one the top-10 mentioned new coins on Twitter in mid-2020 could have seen their investment triple the return of Bitcoin. (Only one of these typically risky initial coin offerings, or ICOs, would sink from its initial price.) The rise of momentum investing has even caught several experienced crypto investors off guard. In May 2020, California-based Cryptolab Capital shuttered its doors after a string of poor Bitcoin returns. Firms like Virgil Capital would resort to fraud to keep the illusion of success going. Momentum, however, is a double-edged sword. The same “hot money” investors are often the first to sell, creating an unrelenting downward spiral. That’s why Dogecoin’s 50% decline last week had investors concerned. Without intervention, the coin was surely set to fall further. Elon Musk to the Rescue Fortunately for Dogecoin holders, though, the coin’s backers had other plans. As Elon Musk and fellow celebrities took to social media in support, DOGE prices started to rise. By the time Musk tweeted “The Dogefather” at 2:20 a.m. on Apr. 28, prices would hit 32 cents the following morning. For Dogecoin, these recoveries matter. Most late-game cryptocurrency investors are “buyers looking to make money,” notes Richard Partington, economics correspondent at The Guardian. Price declines tend to trigger more selling. Trading volume makes the case. DOGE’s initial run to 40 cents coincided with a flurry of buying. As prices came down, volumes remained elevated. In other words, investors were selling out faster than new buyers were entering. Chartists often frustrate fundamental stock pickers with terms like “breakouts” to describe initial price gains leading to further rises (or vice versa to the downside). In the case of Dogecoin, they have a point — a small nudge by a well-timed tweet can become the catalyst to send DOGE to the moon. So, with Dogecoin, invest thoughtfully. It’s no longer investors who are in control of the rocket ship; it’s the famous backers who support the currency of this strange new world.

General Electric Looks Ready to Become a Dividend Grower Once More
General Electric (NYSE:GE) reported Q1 2021 results on Apr. 27. While its adjusted profits were two cents better than analyst estimates, it missed the top-line consensus by $420 million. That news pushed GE stock lower. Source: testing / Shutterstock.com However, despite a mixed quarter, I see a company that looks ready to again become the dividend grower that it was for so many years before — the company General Electric was until it cut its dividend to just a penny back in December 2018. Here’s why I feel this way about GE stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE Stock: Free Cash Flow Is Getting Stronger As any investor worth their salt knows, a company pays its dividends from excess cash. As such, those names that generate healthy cash flow have no problem increasing their dividends from year to year. At the height of its dividend-paying glory in 2008, GE stock paid out $1.24 (split-adjusted) in annual dividends. It’s never been that high since. In that fiscal year, its industrial businesses had cash flow from operating activities of $19.1 billion (Page 75). After subtracting $3 billion in capital expenditures, its industrial business had free cash flow (FCF) of $16.1 billion. In 2020, GE’s four industrial businesses generated FCF of $606 million, down from $2.3 billion in 2019 and $4.8 billion in 2018. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy In 2008, its industrial businesses generated almost 27 times as much FCF as they did in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the industrial businesses had FCF of -$845 million, 62% higher than a year earlier. That’s still not positive, but considerably better than it was at this point last year. On the results, CEO Larry Culp noted: “I am proud of the GE team’s solid first quarter results, despite a still difficult environment for Aviation. We are improving our cash performance and profitability with Industrial free cash flow growth of $1.7 billion year-over-year.” In the results, the company also reiterated its full-year outlook for 2021, stating that GE Industrial’s FCF will be between $2.5 billion and $4.5 billion. That’s a 313% increase over 2020 at the low end of its FCF estimate and a 643% increase at the high end. To get back to $1.24 in dividends paid out annually, GE would have to generate approximately $10.9 billion (8.8 billion shares outstanding multiplied by $1.24) in FCF to accommodate such a payment. So, clearly, this is not going to happen in 2021 or even 2022. However, it could happen in 2023 if Culp’s plans gain further traction and the company’s FCF continues to strengthen. GE and Its Current Dividends Anyone who’s been a long-term GE stock shareholder must find it difficult to see the current dividend yield at a meager 0.3%. This low yield is part of the price that had to be paid for Culp to accelerate debt repayment. Since the end of 2018, GE has reduced its debt by more than $70 billion. This alone makes Culp’s tenure a success. However, it is the CEO’s decentralization efforts that will determine the company’s future. A lean organization that’s closer to the customer ought to help reignite GE’s growth engine. When you consider the fact that this company’s Power and Renewable Energy segments accounted for about 43% of $16 billion-plus in industrial revenue in Q1, but neither made a profit, the upside is actually quite promising from an overall earnings perspective. If both of these segments had 5% profit margins in Q1 2021, you’re talking about a $358 million profit on $7.1 billion in revenue rather than a $321 million loss. That’s a turnaround of almost $700 million. Based on 8.8 billion shares outstanding, that $700 million equates to about eight cents a share in potential dividends that GE could have paid out. I realize this is only theoretical, but imagine how much GE stock would jump on news that it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 700% — from just a penny to eight cents per share. All I know is this would be significant. The Bottom Line on GE Stock I recently recommended GE stock as one of 10 dividend stocks to buy under $25. Part of my rationale for doing so was GE’s sale of GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the company’s aircraft leasing business, to Aercap (NYSE:AER) for $24 billion in cash and 46% of the combined company. I wrote on Mar. 31: “Culp believes the deleveraging and de-risking of its balance sheet puts the company in a better position to focus on its other operating segments. As stated in the press release for the AerCap sale, the ‘deal marks GE’s transformation to a more focused, simpler, and stronger industrial company.” I agree with that sentiment still. Returning to its roots ought to get GE back in the good graces of dividend investors everywhere in due course. In the meantime, take advantage of any volatility on the downside, buying GE stock in the $12 range or even lower. This time next year, we might not be able to include General Electric in a discussion about dividend stocks to buy under $25.

The format continues to sparkle, as I was once again forced to choose between MSNBC's Rachel Maddow or Lawrence O'Donnell and just plain audio. JPA won going away. The talk was crisp and the strategies thick with optimism about the creator economy. Monetization, priming the emergent pump, etc. If this were the Gold Rush, it would be blue skies ahead for picks and shovels and pans.
It remains hard to listen to the creator talk. If this is the moment for creators, then what is the moment for us listening? The question is who gets the short end of the crypto stick, a zero sum game where the losers are the equivalent of who buys high and sells low. I guess in the elegant world of startups, being one and not the other nine of ten is worth it.
It's still damn exciting to see the outcome at a safe distance from ground zero. Once the tech companies run out of slots at the start of the race, there will be plenty of industries waiting for the early smoke to clear. Walmart, table for two? This is not a live audio story but rather a realignment of the media industries around notifications. Let's approach the rebuild of the economy and our way of life from the inside out, or backwards in a kind of reverse engineered insight replayed forward like a Beatles guitar solo.
Back before the virus, we thought of life as weekday and weekends, work week or vacation, a series of not-holidays punctuated by long weekends every 6 to 8 weeks or so.We paced ourselves in waves: not liking Mondays to hump days to going to the movies on Friday to watching the political shows on Sunday. Enduring the nightmare that was Trump, sedating us with the binge economy as it surfed the streaming disruption, addicted to our phones and awestruck by the possibilities of the hive mind. Things changed, and then the plague struck.
Now we realized our folly, not in assuming the unassumable but in thinking we had any clue at all of how much time we had to dream about the future. Our belief in technology was still there, but not necessarily how it would work. Saving us was a goal, not a sure thing or even close. We held our breath. And got incredibly lucky. Time inverted itself, and in surviving we found a desperate grace in treasuring our networks of family and friends.
As much as we knew everything was different, we were shocked at how quickly we adapted to the crisis. The rapid deployment of mobile and social technology over the previous couple decades was suddenly ratified, accelerated, and made table stakes. Not surprisingly the tech companies were able to consume the wave; the startup surge was financed by eating its own dog food. Remember Y2K, where it was still not a sure thing there was any real ROI for collaboration, or groupware as it was pigeonholed.
It got a lot harder to say digital collaboration was not realistic. The Cloud made corporate transformation a subscription service going in and pivoting to market fit a viable exit strategy. Startups could scale up without multi-million dollar bets, leaving enterprise incumbents with no choice but to adopt Software As A Service to survive. Consumer laptops, TCPIP, and 2400 baud modems became the platform where continuous innovation found a home, virtualizing the office as a set of familiar services deployed both on desktop and phones.
Notifications became less a source of interruption and more the quickest way to manage the converging streams of work and personal life. These intermittent alerts allowed us to navigate multiple conversations and interactions on an as-needed basis. Collaboration tools orchestrated the abstraction of email with group messaging, video conferencing became a time saver and easy onboarding tool, screen sharing an IT replacement. And all sat on the notification backbone, reducing channel conflict and shifting the social aspects of team engagement to a more personal basis. And then the pandemic happened.
Is it any wonder, the Bowie song asks. Notification etiquette kicks in at daybreak with the overnight roundup, tracks the news throughout while avoiding the repetitive eyeball-baiting of the cable networks, and creates a calendar of things to click on or store for free time or cram for a meeting. No, it's not any wonder that audio fits more and more into this work-from-wherever climate shift. Notification chimes differentiate between critical alerts, parkable alerts, and ignorable scroll-offs. Newsletters become havens for binging cached 10 minute reads, managing live audio and recorded podcasts, and a rallying point for influencer analytics. This last one offers value for not just creators but consumers, also known as tippers.
The creator bandwagon sounds promising, but who cares which major platform captures the pole position? I like Clubhouse's work in establishing a complementary social cloud via notifications. I like Twitter Spaces as a driver to squeeze a record button into the UI for all, just as Anchor does for podcasting. I like the idea of Facebook sneaking onto the playing field by allowing Instagram to turn off video. Wow, thanks. I love how Josh Constine seems to have landed in just the right place to triangulate his venture casting chops, reportorial finesse, handy summarizing of the calls, and matter-of-fact direct to podcast strategy.
But these early winners in format and style should soon give way to a more constructive dialogue between creators and their listeners. Newsletter platforms seem to have made the case that a few hit writers will pay for developing tools to support subscriptions, distribution, legal services, analytics, and more. I keep wanting to backchannel directly with specific people in the room, but Clubhouse doesn't want that to happen natively. We're live audio, not chat, they don't say but imply. What if listeners could sign up for receiving (and sending) commentary via some form of group @mention. Moderators could tap into that and invite people onstage to engage with speakers. Organic discovery of talent and impact. Sign me up.
