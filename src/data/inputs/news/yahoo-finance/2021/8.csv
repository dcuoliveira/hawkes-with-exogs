SAN GWANN, Malta, Aug. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Email security is one of the main topics of concern for any IT department, and for good reason. Security breaches often lead to loss of sensitive data, operation downtime, and lost revenue. A recent survey of 420+ businesses found that 23% of them, or 1 in 4, reported an email-related security breach. Of these security breaches, 36% were caused by phishing attacks targeting arguably the weakest point of any security system, end-users.
The survey was conducted by the Hornetsecurity Group, a leading email security solutions provider. The company questioned businesses that use the Microsoft 365 platform looking to understand how they handle email security in an increasingly decentralized working environment.
62% of all breaches caused by compromised passwords & phishing attacks
User-compromised passwords and phishing attacks were the reason for 62% of all security breaches reported. 54% of all respondents said they have yet to implement Conditional Access rules, along with Multi-Factor Authentication, which prevents users from logging into their accounts from unsecured networks. A third (33%) of respondents are also yet to implement Multi-Factor Authentication across all users.
68% of companies expect Microsoft 365 to keep them safe from email threats, yet 50% use third-party solutions
There seems to be a disconnect between the expectations that businesses have of Microsoft 365's email security, and the reality: While 2 out of every 3 expect Microsoft to keep them safe from email threats, half of all respondents resort to third-party solutions to supplement email security.
Third-Party Solutions the most effective, with 82% reporting no breaches
Those organizations that use third-party solutions reported the lowest rate of email security breaches in comparison to organizations only using security packages offered by Microsoft 365. 82% of all respondents who use third-party email security solutions reported no breaches.
Additionally, of those who reported paying extra for Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility & Security E3 or E5, 48% still make use of third-party solutions. So, while expectations of Microsoft 365's email security are high, the reality is that most companies believe it's not enough; and the numbers back up that claim.
Companies with between 201-1,000+ employees are the most vulnerable to email security breaches
74% of all security breaches reported in this survey were experienced by companies that fell within the 201-1000+ employee bracket. This is likely due to factors such as budget and recruitment priorities that do not recognize digital security as a major concern. Once the employee count exceeds 1,000, the incidence of an email breach decreases to 17% - probably due to reactions to previous security concerns and the ability to invest in more robust security protocols.

“Facebook has maintained its monopoly position in significant part by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, expressed in 2008: 'it is better to buy than compete,'"" the agency wrote in its refiled suit. ""True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.""
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the FTC's previous filing in June, saying that the agency didn't properly identify how Facebook held an illegal monopoly over the personal social networking space, despite the agency's claims that its acquisitions of Instagram and What's App were meant to quash competition.
Asked about the amended complaint, Facebook stated to Yahoo Finance: ""We are reviewing the F.T.C.’s amended complaint and will have more to say soon.""
The FTC was tasked with rewriting the complaint under the agency's new chair, Lina Khan, a fierce critic of the tech industry. In July, Facebook requested that Khan be blocked from handling the agency's antitrust investigations into the company based on her public criticism of its market power.
The commission's Office of the Secretary, however, dismissed the petition.
In a tandem case brought against Facebook in the same court by 48 attorneys general, Judge Boasberg also ruled in Facebook’s favor and held that the states were barred from bringing their lawsuit because they waited too long to file their claims. The states had long known about Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram and 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp, Boasberg noted, and therefore were legally barred from raising the issue.
On July 28, the states filed a notice indicating their intent to appeal the judge’s dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
The two cases against Facebook are among a handful of closely watched antitrust litigations that states, the federal government, private parties, and consumers have brought against dominant tech firms that also include Google and Apple.
Much like other cases targeting competition tactics of Big Tech, the states and the FTC claim that Facebook used its profitable subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp to illegally monopolize social media markets. In turn, the lawsuits said, the company should be required to divest either company, or both.
“We are pleased that [the] decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints,” Facebook told Yahoo Finance following judge Boasberg’s dismissals. “We compete fairly every day to earn people’s time and attention — and will continue to deliver great products — for the people and businesses that use our services.“

We joke, but Facebook did also make the ""Privacy Checkup"" item much more prominent in this update.

TORONTO, SAO PAULO, MELBOURNE, Australia and LONDON, Aug. 16, 2021 /CNW/ - Today CIBC (TSX: CM) (NYSE: CM), Itaú Unibanco (NYSE: ITUB), National Australia Bank (ASX: NAB) and NatWest Group (LSE: NWG) launched the Global Open Finance Challenge, a virtual event encouraging innovation and the development of new solutions for a global open finance ecosystem.
The event is the second in a series of joint initiatives by CIBC, Itaú Unibanco, National Australia Bank and NatWest Group aimed at building a stronger, more progressive global banking and financial industry.
The four banks, in collaboration with cloud computing leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), are inviting entrepreneurs and innovators to prototype new customer solutions on a global scale. The ideas will address some of the most pressing challenges in the financial services industry, cultivating an open finance ecosystem that allows secure data sharing among financial institutions, and enabling the banks to deliver more choice and customized product offerings for clients around the world, and the public at large.
""The Global Open Finance Challenge will help transform our industry around the world by encouraging innovation and advancing our common goals: to support our clients in an evolving landscape through value-added digital services, more convenient access to the financial ecosystem through the channels customers want, and a continued focus on sustainability.""
- Victor Dodig, President and CEO, CIBC; Milton Maluhy Filho, CEO, Itaú Unibanco; Ross McEwan,
Group CEO, National Australia Bank; Alison Rose, CEO, NatWest Group.
""Financial services companies across the globe are going through rapid digital transformation. By encouraging builders and crowdsourcing new technological ideas, these forward-looking banks running the Global Open Finance Challenge will be able to develop new technologies to meet people's rapidly evolving banking needs. We look forward to collaborating with the builders in the challenge to deliver tangible solutions that help people around the world meet their financial goals,"" said Werner Vogels, Chief Technology Officer, Amazon.com, Inc.
About The Global Open Finance Challenge
The banks have collaborated with Oolys, a leading API infrastructure platform for financial service providers, to develop a sandbox environment that securely runs on AWS. This environment replicates a bank's existing infrastructure, enabling rapid testing with third parties in a safe and secure environment. To aid in the development of applications, each bank will provide a set of shared APIs, including a combination of open banking, open finance, and experimental services. Participating teams can test, build and validate solutions, with mentorship from leaders within the banks and event partners. AWS will collaborate with the four banks to provide participants with advisory support to help them build their concepts in the lead up to the judging event, which includes access to coaching and resources on innovation and product development.
The top 12 teams will present their ideas to an executive judging panel with the CEOs of the four banks, plus executives from private equity, venture capital, and technology organizations:
Victor Dodig, President and CEO, CIBC
Milton Maluhy Filho, CEO, Itaú Unibanco
Ross McEwan, Group CEO, National Australia Bank
Alison Rose, CEO, NatWest Group
Werner Vogels, Chief Technology Officer, Amazon.com
Rob Heyvaert, Managing Partner, Motive Partners
The participating banks have identified three areas Challenge participants may choose to focus on, posing the following questions:
How can we better serve our corporate and business customers, and the public at large, by delivering high-value digital services?
How can we help current and new customers access banking services through more convenient or relevant digital channels?
How can we find innovative ways to help our customers make better decisions around climate and sustainability?
There will be four winning teams selected from the Global Open Finance Challenge, one winner for each of the three key areas identified, and an overall Challenge winner. The winning teams will each have the opportunity to participate in a post-event tailored incubation programme with one or more of the banks, which will include:
Proof of concept with the banks: a dedicated in-bank team to collaborate and support a proof of concept, including feedback from front-line and customer research groups
Ventures pitch: post-event teams will have the opportunity to pitch to all of the banks' ventures teams
Local market guidance: post-event teams can receive exclusive meetings with in-bank teams for education on local market environments
Senior leadership: exposure to internal decision-makers for networking relationship support and partner discussion
Media coverage: the winning teams will be featured in press releases across global and local banking, fintech, and technology media channels
Solution architecture: expert consultants from Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") will provide support on functional and technical designs
How to register
Fintechs, large global organizations, early and late-stage startups, universities, and other teams of innovators are encouraged to join the Challenge. Event registration is open from August 16th: www.globalopenfinancechallenge.com
The Global Open Finance Challenge grand finale event will take place in November 2021.

['Cherlynn Low'],2021-08-19 17:36:06+00:00,,2021-08-19 17:00:51,"The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, but is held back by battery life and potential durability issues.",https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c99b2be0-00f5-11ec-b6ff-6e47595e29c3,en,,"In many ways, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 should be the first foldable for a mainstream audience. It's basically a regular smartphone you can fold in half and it could appeal to the swaths of people who miss the satisfying snap of a flip phone. Plus, with a price drop, the new Flip now costs about the same as an iPhone or Galaxy S flagship. Samsung’s latest foldable also features a larger external display than its predecessor, making it more useful when closed, and has water resistance for some peace of mind. It’s even got a faster screen than Apple and Google offer and nifty software that makes better use of the screen when you prop it up on a surface. But the question remains, even at a more reasonable $1,000, is the Flip 3 good enough to usher foldables into the mainstream or are they still a gimmick?
Design and durability
One of the most important factors in determining if the Flip 3 is ready for daily use is durability. Samsung used stronger aluminum for the Flip 3’s frame, refined its hinge and made the screen tougher with a new flexible PET protector. I can’t tell exactly how much more durable the Flip 3 is compared to its predecessor, but I have been taking more risks with it. In fact, I consider my placing the Flip 3 (and the Fold 3, for that matter) into my bag along with my keys, laptop and DSLR the bravest thing I’ve ever done during a review.
I’m mostly worried because of a bad experience when I took the original Z Flip out for a day. It vibrated off a table and cracked its corner. I’ve been fairly careful with the Flip 3, but I’ve avoided babying it, and so far it’s survived being tossed into a bag with various sharp objects. While it’s still prone to sliding around due to its glossy glass exterior, it’s yet to fall off anything. I’ve placed it on treadmills, ellipticals, window ledges and restaurant tables and I don’t want to jinx it but: so far my Flip 3 is scratch-free.
Does that mean it’ll remain pristine a week, a month or even a year from now? Probably not. But as someone who’s cracked her fair share of phone screens, I feel like the Flip 3 is about as sturdy as most glass-covered flagships.
That is, with one exception: Its flexible internal screen is still more likely to break than others, if for no reason other than you’ll invariably end up pushing into some part of it to close the device. I’ve yet to damage the Flip 3’s screen, and I’ve been careful not to push my thumb into the middle of the panel to close the phone, but I’ve been shutting it with some force. Whether the durability is indeed improved is something that’s hard to tell without months of testing or deliberately trying to damage the device, so I might have to revisit this after some time.
Speaking of closing the phone: Like its predecessor, the Flip 3 isn’t easy to shut with one hand. It can be done, but the hinge is stiff and provides enough resistance to let it stay open at various angles. Unless you have Dwayne Johnson’s hands, you’ll probably need some leverage to open or close the Flip 3.
Oh and thanks to the IPX8 water resistance, I was a lot less worried about leaving the Flip next to my sink when I washed my face and dripped all over it while reaching for the soap.
Besides improved durability and a larger external screen, not much has changed between the new Flip and the last generation. They weigh the same 183 grams (6.45 ounces) and the Flip 3 is a hair thicker. Samsung’s also offering a few new color options, including my two favorites: green and lavender. My review unit is a boring cream/off-white, though.
Phones in the same size and price range like the iPhone 12 Pro Max and Galaxy S21+ are slightly heavier and thicker, but not by much. Of course, these devices are dust-resistant and sport triple cameras, while the Flip has just two. The conventional flagships are also not as narrow. But aside from the aspect ratio, the Flip 3 feels very much like a regular smartphone when unfolded. Bonus: It’s more compact when folded in half, which helps it fit into most of my pockets without peeking out. It actually almost reminds me of a pager when closed. Remember those?
A bigger, more useful Cover Display
The greatest difference between the Flip 3 and a typical smartphone is that you can close it, which is not only a satisfying means of putting your phone away, but also introduces a new way to interact with the device. The 1.9-inch external screen is four times larger than the previous model, and can show up to four lines of notifications at once. There are currently six widgets available for this window, which Samsung calls the Cover Display. To interact with this panel, you’ll have to first double tap on it, then swipe vertically or horizontally to see your notifications or widgets respectively.
This was a little confusing initially, as I didn’t know I needed to tap the screen before swiping. But after figuring it out, I’ve come to appreciate it because it prevents accidentally dismissing notifications and skipping songs on Spotify. That’s pretty helpful since I often unintentionally touch the Cover Display when closing the phone or picking it up.
Most of the time, I leave the Flip 3 closed until I need to reply to a message or when I start browsing my feeds. It’s certainly a lot less distracting to be able to put my phone aside and not have a long list of notifications that I can see from a distance. I initially set all six widgets to appear on my Cover Display, so scrolling sideways would bring up the weather, media controls, Samsung Pay, Health, Calendar and so on.
While I appreciated having all those options, after a while it became clear three widgets is plenty — the endless swiping got tiring eventually. The software is also a little buggy at the moment. The alarms widget, for example, will randomly abandon its countdown if you pause and resume it.
Another feature that sounds great in theory is using your Cover Display as a viewfinder. With the larger panel, you’ll have more room to frame up your selfies on the Flip 3 with the screen closed. I used it to snap a picture with three staff members of my building and while we were able to squeeze everyone in, the novelty wore off quickly.
The only time I can see preferring the outside screen as a viewfinder is if you need the sharper or wider rear cameras or when you’re really in a hurry and can’t spare the one or two seconds it takes to open the phone. I like that Samsung gives us this option, but even a selfie-obsessed person like me was never in that much of a rush to snap a portrait. Plus, the photos taken this way end up in a strange squarish crop, while those snapped using the main screen as a viewfinder are taller or wider.
Internal screen and Flex mode
When you’re back on the main screen, aspect ratio is still somewhat of an issue. The Flip 3’s 6.7-inch display runs at 2,640 x 1,080, which comes up to an uncommon 22:9 format. This didn’t cause too many problems — most apps fit nicely on the screen — but every now and then something will overflow. The pop-up dialogs in Settlers of Catan, for example, disappear into the edges of the display and I can barely tap the buttons I need to move on.
Fortunately, I didn’t encounter this on most of my frequently used apps, but for now Samsung doesn’t have a workaround to help ensure you can see everything on the Flex.
That’s my main issue with the Flip 3’s internal screen, which is otherwise a lovely canvas for browsing Instagram and YouTube thanks to its flexible AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Images were vibrant with deep blacks and high contrast, and the display never stuttered when I scrolled my feeds in a frenzy. Oh I also didn’t mind the crease in the middle — yes it’s noticeable and does cause some distortion, but it doesn’t get in the way of readability. I also like how it felt beneath my thumb as I scrolled past it. It’s like stroking a soft, naked tendon, which is a lot better than it sounds.
Another update that makes the Flip 3 a better multimedia device than before are its stereo speakers. Now, when you hold it up to watch a video, you’ll hear its audio from both ends. It’s a little too easy to cover the bottom speaker with your hand when holding the phone horizontally, though.
Something else the Flip offers that regular smartphones don’t is a Flex mode that kicks in when you half-fold the device. This only works on some apps, like Gallery, Camera and YouTube, where the screen is split in half to show your photo, viewfinder or video on top and navigation, controls or more info at the bottom. When you set the Flip 3 up on a table in Flex mode, you can watch your show as if it were full screen on the top half, while scrolling comments or suggested videos below.
I thought I’d only find Flex mode useful with the Flip 3 sitting on a table (propped up like it has its own kickstand), but it actually was more helpful in enabling one-handed use. Because the screen is so tall, some elements are out of my thumb’s reach. Flex mode makes scrolling pictures in my gallery or snapping a picture much easier with one hand. So far, though, only a handful of apps support this, so Samsung will need to work harder to make more of them compatible.
Cameras
The Flip 3’s dual 12-megapixel cameras hold their own against the likes of the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. While Samsung, Apple and Google all have minor differences in the color temperature of their photos, they deliver similar quality and clarity in most situations. The Flip 3’s picture of a yummy bowl of noodles was just as bright and vibrant as those taken with the Pixel and iPhone, though it’s a little soft and failed to capture some detail on the ceramic surface.
Photos the Flip 3 shot at night are also similar to those from the competition — you’d need to really scrutinize minor exposure and noise differences to tell them apart. The pictures I snapped of a dog park and the city skyline at night all came out bright and colorful, though Google delivered a better closeup of the New York City nightscape thanks to its superior processing software.
The selfies captured by the Flip 3’s 10-megapixel camera were also bright and sharp. And, based on an informal poll on my Instagram, the majority of my followers preferred a portrait shot by the Flip 3 to the Pixel 5.
Living the foldable life: In use and battery
With a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Flip 3 performed smoothly during my testing. I haven’t encountered many delays when using the main screen to message my friends, post to Twitter and browse websites. It didn’t let up even as I recorded the screen while using the camera to capture footage of my friends trying to perform TikTok dances, either.
Occasionally, I felt like websites were scrolling more slowly than I was used to, and there are still some small software bugs (like the Cover Display’s alarm widget) that make the Flip 3 feel like it needs a bit more polish. But aside from these minor gripes and the fact that you can fold it, this phone feels very similar to its Samsung siblings.
That is, until we consider battery life. The Flip 3 never made it through a full day before needing a charge, and that runtime dropped when I enabled the Always On Display for the outer screen. Despite offering a larger Cover Display and a higher refresh rate on its main panel, the Flip 3’s 3,300mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, which might explain its disappointing endurance. Meanwhile, the S21’s 4,000mAh cell typically stuck around for a day and a half, while the latest Pixels and iPhones easily outlast the Flip 3.
Wrap-up
After spending some time with the Flip 3 in the real world, I’ve come to realize a few things: I like being able to fold a phone, put it away and focus on work or living in the moment. But I can also turn a regular phone face down to do that. I enjoy the nostalgia and novelty of closing the Flip 3 when I’m mad at a caller or an app, too.
In general, the satisfaction and space savings from being able to fold a phone in half are not worth paying a premium for. The good news is that with the Flip 3, Samsung isn’t charging a hefty premium or making many compromises. Battery life is an unfortunate victim of the Flip 3’s larger external screen, but it’s at least not so short that you’ll need to charge it twice a day.
Ultimately, the Flip 3 is proof that Samsung can deliver a good phone with a foldable display at a relatively reasonable price. It’s also a satisfying upgrade from its predecessor, thanks to its water resistance and bigger outside screen. The most important question now is: Who should buy this? If you pride yourself on being an early adopter and want to get on the foldables bandwagon before they become more common, that might be you. The Flip 3 is a device capable of being a daily driver for those nostalgic or curious enough to buy one. But for a more mainstream audience, there simply aren’t enough benefits yet.
The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, thanks to water resistance and a larger, more useful Cover Display. Its $1,000 starting price puts it in the same class as flagships from Apple, Google and Samsung itself, too. While it mostly behaves like a regular modern smartphone that you can fold in half, the Flip 3 is held back by battery life and potential durability issues.

After more than three months of lows in the crypto market since 2021 began, due in parts to Tesla's turn from accepting Bitcoin for payment, the combined value of the world's cryptocurrencies hit $2 trillion in August and investors are growing optimistic again that it will reach record highs it reached earlier in the year and even surpass it.

(OTC: BTZI), (“BOTS” or ""The Company""), a global technology company specialized in Blockchain-based solutions including decentralized finance applications for the financial industry, cybersecurity solutions, crypto mining, consulting, mining equipment repair and insurance announced today that it began allowing local car dealerships to accept cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin for preowned TESLA EV cars.
BTZI became one of the first publicly traded companies to accept Dogecoin as a payment for its products and services.
Back in May, 2021 Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the car company would no longer accept bitcoin to purchase its vehicles, citing concerns about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrency. Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that it made history by purchasing $1.5 billion in bitcoin — before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.
""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Musk said in a statement posted to his Twitter account.
Last month Elon Musk said: “Tesla will 'most likely' restart accepting bitcoin as payments”.
As cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and dogecoin gain in popularity, many car dealers and manufacturers have recognized this as an opportunity to reach new customers. BTZI will be offering Dogecoin merchant processing services to Pre-owned TESLA EV dealers and individuals first.
A recent report by Observer.com indicated that global shortage of microchips since last year has forced automakers to cut back on new car production, therefore causing prices of used cars to surge to a point where some popular models are fetching higher prices on second-hand markets than their brand-new counterparts. A lightly used Tesla Model 3 sedan, for example, now costs an average $1,300, or 2.9 percent, more than the brand-new version sold on Tesla website, according to a study by the automotive research site iSeeCars.com that analyzed over 470,000 new and used cars from the 2019 and 2020 model years listed for sale in June 2021.
“Buyers are willing to pay extra for a used Tesla Model 3 because the Model 3 is still relatively uncommon in the used car marketplace. And despite the high resale value of its used versions, it is the most affordable Tesla available,” iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer told Observer. “It appeals to a wide audience from tech enthusiasts to eco-minded consumers to those who want a fun-to-drive sporty car.”
A Model 3 sedan currently retails for anywhere from $35,690 to $52,690 (after government incentives and gas savings). An average new Model 3 in iSeeCars’ study sells for $44,409, while a lightly used version is listed for $45,677.
Avoiding a seven- to 11-week wait is the main motivator for people to pay a little extra on a second-hand Tesla. “Buyers are likely drawn to buying a lightly used Tesla Model 3 on a lot rather than waiting weeks for the delivery of a new vehicle,” Brauer said in a report of the study.
Model 3 is the only Tesla car the study looked at. But it may not always be the most popular Tesla car on the used car market. “Given the popularity of SUVs, the Model 3 will likely lose some of its popularity to the Model Y as that vehicle enters the used car marketplace in the coming years,” Brauer said.
“The used car market is extremely hot at the moment due to the ongoing chip shortage,” Katrin Zimmermann, a managing director at TLGG Consulting who specializes in the automobile industry, told Observer. “At the same time, EV adoption continues to improve…Consumer demand for personal vehicles climbed throughout the pandemic, often bolstered by trends in capital liquidity. When taken together, these dynamics create a perfect storm for the increasing value of used Model 3s.”
Businessinsider.com reported on Aug 15, 2021 that Elon Musk backs Mark Cuban's claim that dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban's claim that dogecoin is the strongest cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange has been backed up by long-time Doge fan, Elon Musk. Cuban told CNBC last week that ""the community for Doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange."" In response to CNBC's article about Cuban's claims, Tesla boss Musk tweeted on Saturday: ""I've been saying this for a while.""
Both celebrity businessmen have been drawn to Dogecoin for its light-hearted nature and strong community – and they have been important to its 8,000% gain over the last year.
However, cryptocurrency skeptics struggle to see what Musk and Cuban see in Dogecoin, which is highly volatile and more complicated to use for purchases than mainstream payment methods.
BOTS Inc managements agrees with Elon Musk and Mark Cuban and decided to offer this crypto merchant account services to allow TESLA EV enthusiasts to purchase the preowned cars with Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies and later to offer cryptocurrency acceptance services to other car manufactures and dealerships.
According to the report published by Allied Market Research, the global used cars market was pegged at $828.24 billion in 2019 and is estimated to hit $1.355 trillion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 8.3% from 2020 to 2027. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the top investment pockets, top winning strategies, drivers & opportunities, market size & estimations, competitive landscape, and changing market trends.

Much like a feature it added to its Apple Watch app last May, Spotify's updated Wear OS app will let you stream and download music straight to your watch, so you can listen to it without the need for a smartphone or even a connection.
""In the coming weeks, Spotify users will be able to play their favorite playlists, albums, and podcasts with their smartwatches that run Wear OS,"" the company wrote on its blog. ""By having Spotify on your wrist, you’re more free to run, dance, shop, cook, and socialize—and control your music and podcasts at the same time. Plus, we’re excited to unveil one of the most requested features by our users: the ability to download all of your favorite music and podcasts to your smartwatch.""
Spotify noted that the update will arrive on smartwatches from Fossil, Mobvoi and Suunto, along with Samsung's latest devices. It should also work on older watches too, as Spotify notes that it ""requires your smartwatch to run at least Wear OS 2.0 or higher.""
Once you have the latest app on your Wear OS watch, you'll need to have headphones paired directly to your watch. From there, you can stream music, playlists and podcasts directly with no need for a phone. You can also choose content to download directly to your watch, and once that's done, you'll see a green arrow next to the items. Spotify said the new version would be rolling out ""in the coming weeks.""",finance.yahoo.com,Spotify's latest Wear OS app supports direct streaming and downloads,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-is-adding-support-for-downloads-to-its-wear-os-app-074541352.html,"['GOOGL', 'AAPL']","[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Samsung', 'normalized': 'Samsung', 'company_key': None, 'start': 19, 'end': 26, 'score': 0.9961938858032221}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Galaxy Watch 4', 'normalized': 'Galaxy Watch 4', 'company_key': None, 'start': 29, 'end': 43, 'score': 0.9984850287437431}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 55, 'end': 61, 'score': 0.9969934225082391}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 68, 'end': 70, 'score': 0.961472034454345}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##ar OS', 'normalized': '##ar OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 70, 'end': 75, 'score': 0.9517513513565061}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 85, 'end': 92, 'score': 0.9951562881469721}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 136, 'end': 138, 'score': 0.9437587261199951}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##ar OS', 'normalized': '##ar OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 138, 'end': 143, 'score': 0.925835371017456}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Apple', 'normalized': 'AAPL', 'company_key': 'AAPL', 'start': 208, 'end': 213, 'score': 0.8532227277755731}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Watch', 'normalized': 'Watch', 'company_key': None, 'start': 214, 'end': 219, 'score': 0.806622803211212}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 234, 'end': 241, 'score': 0.996134281158447}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 252, 'end': 254, 'score': 0.9493169784545891}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##ar OS', 'normalized': '##ar OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 254, 'end': 259, 'score': 0.924903631210327}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 429, 'end': 436, 'score': 0.9905600547790521}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 544, 'end': 546, 'score': 0.9704698920249931}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##ar OS', 'normalized': '##ar OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 546, 'end': 551, 'score': 0.836805045604705}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 596, 'end': 603, 'score': 0.8848273754119871}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 895, 'end': 902, 'score': 0.9917975664138791}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Fossil', 'normalized': 'Fossil', 'company_key': None, 'start': 958, 'end': 964, 'score': 0.8809453845024101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Mobvoi', 'normalized': 'Mobvoi', 'company_key': None, 'start': 966, 'end': 972, 'score': 0.7270020246505731}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Suunto', 'normalized': 'Suunto', 'company_key': None, 'start': 977, 'end': 983, 'score': 0.7315596938133241}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Samsung', 'normalized': 'Samsung', 'company_key': None, 'start': 996, 'end': 1003, 'score': 0.998279213905334}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1067, 'end': 1074, 'score': 0.9931623339653011}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1131, 'end': 1133, 'score': 0.9860293269157411}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'OS 2', 'normalized': 'OS 2', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1136, 'end': 1140, 'score': 0.8716875910758971}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '0', 'normalized': '0', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1141, 'end': 1142, 'score': 0.965153336524963}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'We', 'normalized': 'We', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1192, 'end': 1194, 'score': 0.6814332604408261}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##ar OS', 'normalized': '##ar OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1194, 'end': 1199, 'score': 0.7750531435012811}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Spotify', 'normalized': 'Spotify', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1491, 'end': 1498, 'score': 0.9935910105705261}]","{'negative': 0.0007813193951730001, 'neutral': 0.567071676254272, 'positive': 0.43214699625968905}","{'neutral': 0.901709973812103, 'joy': 0.056046973913908005, 'surprise': 0.028221322223544003, 'anger': 0.005736989434808001, 'sadness': 0.004179303068667001, 'disgust': 0.002833342179656, 'fear': 0.001272054272703}",2021/e85830ccb8569b20e193c39e3145c1b172e79f878c17ce42c65a802299ab66b3.json,8

It might be time to move on. Reddit users and 91mobiles have learned that Google will no longer let you sign into the company's apps on devices running Android 2.3.7 (Gingerbread) or lower from September 27th onward. You can still sign in on the web, but you'll have to update to at least the tablet-only Android 3.0 (realistically, Android 4.0) if you want to avoid major hassles while checking Gmail or navigating with Google Maps.
The cutoff is necessary to protect account privacy, Google said in an email to customers. We've asked Google if can elaborate on its reasoning.
This won't affect day-to-day phone use for many people, as you might guess. Gingerbread and earlier Android releases have so little usage share that they've been lumped into the ""other"" category for years, and the hardware already struggles to handle many modern tasks. However, it does mark a rare instance of Google cutting off basic functionality for older Android versions, not just OS updates or Play Services features. Think of this as Google setting a baseline — you'll need a device updated within the last decade to receive at least rudimentary support.",finance.yahoo.com,Google won't let you sign in with very old Android versions after September 27th,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ends-sign-in-support-for-old-android-versions-193130157.html,['GOOGL'],"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Nexus One', 'normalized': 'Nexus One', 'company_key': None, 'start': 30, 'end': 39, 'score': 0.8932085633277891}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Reddit', 'normalized': 'Reddit', 'company_key': None, 'start': 94, 'end': 100, 'score': 0.6432202458381651}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 139, 'end': 145, 'score': 0.9973059892654411}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Android', 'normalized': 'Android', 'company_key': None, 'start': 217, 'end': 224, 'score': 0.9983239769935601}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '3', 'normalized': '3', 'company_key': None, 'start': 227, 'end': 228, 'score': 0.5303265452384941}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##bre', 'normalized': '##bre', 'company_key': None, 'start': 238, 'end': 241, 'score': 0.7036197185516351}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Android 3', 'normalized': 'Android 3', 'company_key': None, 'start': 370, 'end': 379, 'score': 0.9850445985794061}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '0', 'normalized': '0', 'company_key': None, 'start': 380, 'end': 381, 'score': 0.8297652602195741}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Android 4', 'normalized': 'Android 4', 'company_key': None, 'start': 398, 'end': 407, 'score': 0.869592428207397}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'G', 'normalized': 'G', 'company_key': None, 'start': 461, 'end': 462, 'score': 0.989448428153991}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google Maps', 'normalized': 'Google Maps', 'company_key': None, 'start': 486, 'end': 497, 'score': 0.9815782904624931}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 551, 'end': 557, 'score': 0.998315334320068}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 601, 'end': 607, 'score': 0.9984661340713501}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': '##bre', 'normalized': '##bre', 'company_key': None, 'start': 725, 'end': 728, 'score': 0.5831859707832331}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Android', 'normalized': 'Android', 'company_key': None, 'start': 743, 'end': 750, 'score': 0.9974862337112421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 954, 'end': 960, 'score': 0.9971643090248101}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Android', 'normalized': 'Android', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1003, 'end': 1010, 'score': 0.997407853603363}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'OS', 'normalized': 'OS', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1030, 'end': 1032, 'score': 0.970718801021575}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Play', 'normalized': 'Play', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1044, 'end': 1048, 'score': 0.7125664353370661}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Services', 'normalized': 'Services', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1049, 'end': 1057, 'score': 0.948205173015594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Google', 'normalized': 'GOOGL', 'company_key': 'GOOGL', 'start': 1085, 'end': 1091, 'score': 0.9977422952651971}]","{'negative': 0.9170318245887751, 'neutral': 0.081666968762874, 'positive': 0.0013012677663930001}","{'neutral': 0.9023522138595581, 'sadness': 0.055027749389410005, 'surprise': 0.017115989699959002, 'disgust': 0.011244743131101001, 'anger': 0.008274062536656001, 'fear': 0.0032791451085350002, 'joy': 0.002706107683479}",2021/5eda780adf09c930ccca0904e3dfde896255706e7665e0c4071c252bbbba5bfc.json,8

Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 4, 2021. It’s been hectic: Robinhood’s stock lost its mind. Facebook made another chunk of the internet mad. And a new unicorn wants to go public? It’s been a great day for tech news.

The TechCrunch Top 3
Robinhood’s stock does insane things: Robinhood users were involved in the GameStop and AMC trading frenzies earlier this year. So perhaps it was inevitable that Robinhood’s own stock would get caught in a similar updraft. That’s what happened today, with shares of the newly public fintech company soaring far, far above its IPO price. So much for the Robinhood public offering being underwhelming!
Human Interest is now a unicorn, wants to go public: With a fresh $100 million round constructed of bricks of cash from both TPG and SoftBank, Human Interest’s SMB 401(k) service is now worth $1 billion. Per our own Mary Ann, it’s “targeting a traditional IPO sometime in 2023, with execs saying the target is to have ‘$200 million+ in run-rate revenue before going public.’” More of this sort of clear planning, please.
Neobanks’ improving economics could hint at future IPOs: Checking in on the recent financial performance of a few neobanks, TechCrunch discovers quite a lot to like in the numbers. There are some laggards, but the huge, global venture capital bet on the fintech banking model appears to be set to pay off.
Startups/VC
Denver’s Reserve Trust reloads for business payments: It takes a bit of explaining, but moving money around the world is hard without a partner bank. Reserve Trust wants to help companies move their funds directly, sans banking partners. And it just raised $30.5 million to do so. The issues of accepting and moving money online are huge problem spaces, evidence of which you can see in this section of Daily Crunch most days, it feels.
ispace is going to the moon: Japanese space tech company ispace has raised a fresh $46 million Series C to help it undertake a number of lunar missions in the coming years. Three missions in three years, it turns out. The new capital is to support its second and third launches which should come -- take off? -- in 2023 and 2024.
FullStory raises $103M to make digital UIs suck less: By tracking where users click in confusion, anger or frustration, FullStory wants to help companies improve their various digital interfaces. If you hate how some apps are built (and who doesn’t), FullStory could be good news. The Atlanta-based company is now worth $1.8 billion.
More money to buy up e-commerce brands: The global push to raise capital, buy e-commerce brands and unify them under a single aegis is a huge area of venture capital investment. Today’s round is Suma Brands, which now has $150 million to execute acquisitions. The new capital is mostly debt, it turns out.
tabby raises $50M Series B for Middle Eastern BNPL work: We have a new buy now, pay later round for you today. This time it’s tabby, which is based in Dubai and has a focus on its local region. Global Founders Capital and STV led the funding round, which also included a host of other venture capital firms like Mubadala Investment Capital and Raed Ventures.
Work-Bench closes $100M new fund: New York-based Work-Bench has raised a new fund to invest in enterprise SaaS companies. In a world of megafunds and billion-dollar deals, the firm is staying smaller than it probably could have grown. (It also dropped some research on the New York tech scene that I’m chewing on.)

What Square’s acquisition of Afterpay means for startups
In his first column since returning to TechCrunch, reporter Ryan Lawler considered the potential ripples Square's purchase of Afterpay may send across the pond of buy now, pay later startups.
For commentary and perspective, he interviewed:
Dan Rosen, founder and general partner, Commerce Ventures
Jake Gibson, founding partner, Better Tomorrow Ventures
TX Zhuo, partner, Fika Ventures
Matthew Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures
The investors he spoke to agreed that deferring payments helps drive e-commerce, ""but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups,"" reports Ryan.

Big Tech Inc.
Match Group to bring live audio and video to its dating apps: A sign of the times, perhaps? The company behind OkCupid, Tinder and other dating apps intends to build out their chat and video capabilities. Let’s be honest, this isn’t a bad idea given how many of us are still stuck at home.
Company that made crashing planes can’t get rocket into space: That’s the news from Boeing and its Starliner capsule. Apparently the aerospace company’s current efforts to put humans into space are really struggling. More space in the market, then, for SpaceX and Blue Origin? Perhaps.
GM earnings dinged by its old electric car; new electric cars not impacted: That’s the story on TechCrunch regarding GM’s Q2 2021 earnings. The Chevy Bolt recalls were expensive, but the company’s future EV tech appears to be unaffected by the issues. In numerical terms, GM had revenues of $34.2 billion in the quarter, earning it net income of $2.84 billion.

TikTok today confirmed it's piloting a new feature, TikTok Stories, which will allow it to explore additional ways for its community to bring their creative ideas to life.
The company notes the new feature will be another option, in addition to its existing storytelling tools like videos, Duets, Stitch, and LIVE -- it's not meant to replace them.
TikTok didn't say how long the pilot test would run or whether it would result in a public launch. However, we understand the test has been running for several days, not weeks or months, and is available in a small handful of non-U.S. markets for the time being, with the goal of gaining insight and feedback from TikTok users.
The current set of features may or may not make it to the public product, either, we should warn.
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
The feature was discovered by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who is often among the first to find new features in social apps. In this case, he tells us that several tipsters brought screenshots of TikTok Stories to him, but it was initially unclear whether or not it was a hoax.
The timing, of course, was somewhat suspect -- Twitter had just shut down Fleets in what was a fairly high-profile example of a failure to make Stories work on a social platform, despite their popularity on other popular apps, like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and even, as of late, Pinterest.
From the screenshots and videos of TikTok Stories in action, we see a product that appears to be, for the most part, something that looks familiar to users of Stories on other platforms.
Users can tap a camera button from the new navigation bar on the left side of the screen to create their first Story, then use common tools like those to add text or stickers, insert sounds, and even use effects on their content. Like other platforms, users can either record videos or upload photos -- the latter which opens up TikTok to take advantage of users' larger camera rolls, rather than relying only on video.
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
Where TikTok's version of Stories differentiates itself is that it allows users to comment publicly on the creator's content. These comments are public, the app explains, as mutual friends can see each other's comments. There is also another tab where you can see how many people viewed a given Story, and whether or not you're following those users. A button will allow you to click to follow people back, if you choose.
TikTok's Stories are also ephemeral and disappear in 24 hours, the app's tutorial explains.
To view Stories from other creators, you can scroll through the new sidebar and tap on the creator's avatar to watch their content. (This almost looks like a vertical version of Twitter's Fleets bar, even down to the blue rings around creator's profile photos.)
The addition of Stories offers TikTok users who don't post with regularity (or at all), an easier way to start engaging with TikTok's tools by getting started with a more comfortable and familiar format. It can also provide creators with a way to interact casually with fans in between their more polished and edited TikTok video posts.
But it also gives TikTok a much larger surface where it could eventually run advertisements, assuming it can first properly moderate the inevitable attempts at skirting its community guidelines that result from launching an ""ephemeral"" feature.
The feature is also a direct shot across Instagram's bow, following the Facebook-owned app's direct attempt to copy TikTok with Reels.
TikTok declined to say which markets, specifically, can try out TikTok Stories. Screenshots show the feature described in English and on Android phones, however.
Though Stories may have failed on Twitter, the platform isn't known for being a home for rich, creative tools, like TikTok. Meanwhile, TikTok believes in exploring any creative tool that could allow its users to express themselves -- whether that's through video, live streaming, interacting with others, or now, through ephemeral, short-form content.",finance.yahoo.com,TikTok confirms pilot test of TikTok Stories is now underway,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-confirms-pilot-test-tiktok-211755550.html,['FB'],"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Twitter', 'normalized': 'Twitter', 'company_key': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 7, 'score': 0.961361169815063}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Stories', 'normalized': 'Stories', 'company_key': None, 'start': 31, 'end': 38, 'score': 0.834952294826507}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Fleet', 'normalized': 'Fleet', 'company_key': None, 'start': 57, 'end': 62, 'score': 0.6537258625030511}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Stories', 'normalized': 'Stories', 'company_key': None, 'start': 73, 'end': 80, 'score': 0.8608515858650201}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'TikTok', 'normalized': 'TikTok', 'company_key': None, 'start': 136, 'end': 142, 'score': 0.9403018355369561}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'T', 'normalized': 'T', 'company_key': None, 'start': 188, 'end': 189, 'score': 0.51468425989151}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': '##Tok', 'normalized': '##Tok', 'company_key': None, 'start': 191, 'end': 194, 'score': 0.8781778812408441}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Stories', 'normalized': 'Stories', 'company_key': None, 'start': 195, 'end': 202, 'score': 0.802128553390502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'word': 'Due', 'normalized': 'Due', 'company_key': None, 'start': 426, 'end': 429, 'score': 0.8534405231475831}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'TikTok', 'normalized': 'TikTok', 'company_key': None, 'start': 485, 'end': 491, 'score': 0.8985217809677121}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'U.

['Saqib Shah'],2021-08-19 17:35:16+00:00,,2021-08-19 12:29:54,Amazon is reportedly planning on opening larger US retail locations similar to mini department stores.,https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Famazon-department-stores-122954800.html.json,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BPEZ7XtNqj9_v.Qwzgek_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMzMz/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a5fc1810-00e7-11ec-b36f-77c251e4c2a1,en,,"Amazon is preparing to increase its brick and mortar footprint in a big way. The retailer plans to open several large physical locations in the US akin to department stores, according to anonymous sources cited by The Wall Street Journal. The new stores — the first of which will come to Ohio and California — will sell clothing, household items and electronics from ""top consumer brands."" Obviously, shoppers can also expect to run into Amazon's own-brand products, too.
While the sites are tipped to be around the third of the size of a typical department store at 30,000 square feet, they'll still be much larger than Amazon's other physical locations. The move sees the company expanding into an area it originally disrupted as it grew into an all-in-one online shopping destination.
With their sales already plummeting, the pandemic sealed the fate of several high-profile department stores. The likes of J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus Group have filed for bankruptcy along with other big names in the sector. Though some were thrown a lifeline when they managed to attract new owners.
Amazon, on the other hand, has seen its fortunes skyrocket during the pandemic as it profited from an increasing shift toward e-commerce. Its booming business even helping to bankroll founder Jeff Bezos' trip into space.
Amazon's move into physical retail predates the virus, however. The company started with brick and mortar bookstores back in 2015, later acquiring Whole Foods for $13.4 billion in 2017. More recently, it opened cashierless Amazon Go stores in the US and UK. Not to mention its highly-curated Amazon 4-star stores and Amazon Pop-Ups inside malls.
The larger stores are apparently viewed as a way of letting shoppers try before they buy, which is particularly useful for things like apparel. That's an area where Amazon has historically struggled. As the WSJ notes, the only high-fashion label on its online store is Oscar de la Renta. It also lost a major seller in Nike in 2019, which decided to go it alone in e-commerce — a move that has paid off for the sneaker company.",finance.yahoo.com,Amazon is reportedly planning to open mini department stores,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-department-stores-122954800.html,"['AMZN', 'NKE']","[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Amazon', 'normalized': 'AMZN', 'company_key': 'AMZN', 'start': 0, 'end': 6, 'score': 0.9982556700706481}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'US', 'normalized': 'US', 'company_key': None, 'start': 144, 'end': 146, 'score': 0.99888390302658}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'The Wall Street Journal', 'normalized': 'The Wall Street Journal', 'company_key': None, 'start': 214, 'end': 237, 'score': 0.996803283691406}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'Ohio', 'normalized': 'Ohio', 'company_key': None, 'start': 288, 'end': 292, 'score': 0.9996986389160151}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'word': 'California', 'normalized': 'California', 'company_key': None, 'start': 297, 'end': 307, 'score': 0.9997393488883971}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Amazon', 'normalized': 'AMZN', 'company_key': 'AMZN', 'start': 438, 'end': 444, 'score': 0.8370058536529541}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Amazon', 'normalized': 'AMZN', 'company_key': 'AMZN', 'start': 621, 'end': 627, 'score': 0.886653661727905}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'J.

The amended complaint comes after a federal judge threw out the agency's initial suit back in June. In dismissing the case, Judge James Boasberg said the FTC had failed to provide enough evidence Facebook had a monopoly in the social media market. Boasberg gave the FTC 30 days to amend its case, later extending that deadline to August 19th.
The new complaint is approximately two dozen pages longer than the original but put forwards many of the same core arguments. Specifically, the FTC alleges Facebook used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 to secure its position in the market. The agency says the amended complaint includes additional data and evidence to support its claims that Facebook is a monopolist.
""Facebook has maintained its monopoly position in significant part by pursuing Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, expressed in 2008: 'it is better to buy than compete,'"" the FTC says in the document. ""True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.""
In July, the company, following the lead of Amazon, petitioned the FTC to recuse Commissioner Lina Khan from discussions on whether or not the regulator should push forward with another antitrust case against the company. In a press release, the FTC said the agency's ""Office of General Counsel carefully reviewed Facebook’s petition to recuse Chair Lina M. Khan. As the case will be prosecuted before a federal judge, the appropriate constitutional due process protections will be provided to the company. The Office of the Secretary has dismissed the petition.""",finance.yahoo.com,FTC files amended antitrust complaint against Facebook,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html,"['AMZN', 'FB']","[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Federal Trade Commission', 'normalized': 'Federal Trade Commission', 'company_key': None, 'start': 4, 'end': 28, 'score': 0.999288499355316}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 30, 'end': 33, 'score': 0.998930573463439}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 75, 'end': 83, 'score': 0.9964052438735961}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'James Boasberg', 'normalized': 'James Boasberg', 'company_key': None, 'start': 215, 'end': 229, 'score': 0.9793536663055421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 239, 'end': 242, 'score': 0.9985626935958861}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 281, 'end': 289, 'score': 0.9973291158676141}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Bo', 'normalized': 'Bo', 'company_key': None, 'start': 333, 'end': 335, 'score': 0.9894899725914}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': '##asberg', 'normalized': '##asberg', 'company_key': None, 'start': 335, 'end': 341, 'score': 0.587901830673217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 351, 'end': 354, 'score': 0.9982988834381101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 572, 'end': 575, 'score': 0.9987938404083251}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 584, 'end': 592, 'score': 0.998431146144866}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'In', 'normalized': 'In', 'company_key': None, 'start': 618, 'end': 620, 'score': 0.9992130994796751}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': '##stagram', 'normalized': '##stagram', 'company_key': None, 'start': 620, 'end': 627, 'score': 0.980981111526489}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'WhatsApp', 'normalized': 'WhatsApp', 'company_key': None, 'start': 632, 'end': 640, 'score': 0.9987410902976991}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 799, 'end': 807, 'score': 0.9970404505729671}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 826, 'end': 834, 'score': 0.9979895353317261}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'normalized': 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'company_key': None, 'start': 928, 'end': 943, 'score': 0.9827602505683891}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1016, 'end': 1019, 'score': 0.998056888580322}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 1063, 'end': 1071, 'score': 0.9983773231506341}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Amazon', 'normalized': 'AMZN', 'company_key': 'AMZN', 'start': 1231, 'end': 1237, 'score': 0.9966314435005181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1254, 'end': 1257, 'score': 0.9985374212265011}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Lin', 'normalized': 'Lin', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1281, 'end': 1284, 'score': 0.9991766810417171}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': '##a Khan', 'normalized': '##a Khan', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1284, 'end': 1290, 'score': 0.8889801502227781}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'FTC', 'normalized': 'FTC', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1433, 'end': 1436, 'score': 0.9985651969909661}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Office of General Counsel', 'normalized': 'Office of General Counsel', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1456, 'end': 1481, 'score': 0.9967346191406251}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'word': 'Facebook', 'normalized': 'FB', 'company_key': 'FB', 'start': 1501, 'end': 1509, 'score': 0.9983938336372371}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': 'Lin', 'normalized': 'Lin', 'company_key': None, 'start': 1537, 'end': 1540, 'score': 0.9990825653076171}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'word': '##a M.
